I've encountered this essay before, but in the present context the *temporality* of the mirror stage, rather than the concept of *imago* itself sticks out as the most argumentative point of Lacan's essay. When I say "the present context," I'm referring specifically to instances in which an image of the self arises that is constructed by the very being that comes to be understood as "self." In Hegel---and in Marx, as this is the part of Hegel Marx emphasizes and elevates above the rest---the bondsman's self is reflected (though of course not literally) in the products of labor. Self-consciousness comes about precisely because of a recognition of the self through transformation of matter combined with the recognition of being-for-self (in the form of the Master), a dyad which might be understood in terms of action and the social. Here, the recognition of self occurs only after the deed and the social interaction, but Lacan makes clear that recognition the self that he's talking about has to occur before either. First, action or anything approaching transformative labor is dismissed by pointing out that recognition happens when the child is "outdone by the chimpanzee in instrumental intelligence"; next, this is the process by which the simply agentive ego is established, which is understood as prior to (and presumably a preconditon of) social determination. 

This is clearly a different type of self-consciousness than the one discussed in Hegel's Lord and Bondsman scenario, though, a type that precedes the I that "is objectified in the dialectic of identification with the other." If it is possible, as it is in Lacan's system, for such an I to precede the process of dialectic identification with an other, I'm unsure whether to understand the I as a prologue to Hegel's version of the story or as a disagreement with it. In mentioning Hegel's system, though, Lacan seems to be implicitly including it as a part of his own, which suggests that the formation of Lacan's I would have to be understood as the creation of consciousness, not self-consciousness---though without being familiar with the chapters in Hegel's *Phenomenology* discussing consciousness, I can't say how these two formulations would conflict. 

There is something very interesting in the idea that, in order to understand (or invent?) the relation between self and reality, the self has to be perceived *visually* just as reality is perceived visually: the *imago* "establish[es] a relation between the organism and its reality---or, as they say, between the *Innenwelt* and the *Umwelt*." Translating "Innenwelt" and "Umwelt" as something like interior life and environment, it is not the recognition of the ability to change the environment (as in Hegel), but the recognition that the visual field contains the self under certain circumstances. (A full consciousness of others, a social consciousness, would seem to require a further set of steps, including realizing that the potential visual field also includes the self from another person's perspective.) It seems that this basic shape would have to be repeated in the social sphere as well as the visual, but unlike Hegel's recognition of self in other, Lacan's system seems to stress first the recognition of an *Umwelt* that contains both self and other. I'm after kind of a vague distinction here, but by beginning with the recognition of a reality as a whole *outside* of the self, Lacan's version of the story could ironically lead to a less self-centered ontology, despite the obvious resonances between Narcissus and the visual self.
