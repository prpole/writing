I'm trying to decide if I think it's hard to reconcile Sartre's call for Europeans to decolonize themselves---similar to what I've heard elsewhere referred to as "decolonizing knowledge"---with his praise of Fanon's writing "for his brothers" and largely ignoring the European except as an "object" of history. It makes sense, of course, in terms of the extension of the lord/bondsman dialectic, insofar as both become in a certain sense enslaved through their involvement in the entire structure. This view becomes particularly powerful in his rendering of the Europeans as the tools of domination, not the victors in a struggle or the beneficiaries of the system: they "only dimly remember that they were human beings; they take themselves to be riding crops or guns."[^1] In this line of thinking, only the decolonization of the self on the part of the "lord" can provide him or her with a way out of the dehumanization inherent in both sides of this equation. An "out" is created for the lord to parallel the bondsman's potential for final liberation through the creation of an object that enables self-recognition; the bondsman's way out of the circuit in Hegel's telling leaves the lord pretty much in the same position, but in this revision it is possible for the lord to be freed from the dialectic as well by recognizing it as such. So, in this sense, there seems to be no contradiction between decolonizing the European consciousness and the decision of the colonized group to represent its self to itself and itself alone. But on the other hand, to take Fanon's writing as ignoring the European reader discounts the effect the work itself can have on this very decolonization. Also, writing only within the community of the colonized, while it may counter to an extent the internalization of economic subjugation, prevents any countering of the economic subjugation itself from within the society of consumers---granting something like a world system, this economic subjugation would come largely from such a pattern of consumption. (And isn't it Fanon himself who elsewhere points out that Europe was, in a very real sense, created by the global south?)

At risk of 1) straying and 2) thinking more about "On Violence" than what we specifically read for this week, I'm trying to use Fanon to think about the news and having a difficult time of it. I'm thinking of the latest beheading, wondering if this should be taken as an act of decolonization, and thinking that it is much more difficult to think about the simultaneously wounding and healing spear of Achilles while being reminded of what violence actually looks like. To counter this more or less immediately on my own: the violence we see on the news is of course by no means coextensive with the violence that occurs. Drone strikes, for example, are carefully kept from sight, and it is only on this basis that the actions of a militant group can be called "pure evil" in a press release from the office that commands those drones. Nevertheless, it is hard not to wish for every means---destructive or otherwise---short of actual violence, whatever criticisms that leaves me open to....

[^1]: Some potentially interesting resonances with *Capital* Vol. 1 here, too, in terms of what happens to the body of the worker within division of labor. (Can't find the relevant quotes just now, this is mostly a note to self.)
