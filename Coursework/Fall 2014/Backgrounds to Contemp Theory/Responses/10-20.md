When Max Weber speaks of the necessity for a professor not to be political, he appears to mean it in the sense in which it is identified with party politics, as described by Carl Schmitt. The type of words used at a political meeting, according to Weber, have no place in the lecture room because they "are not means of scientific analysis but means of canvassing votes and winning over others. They are not plowshares to loosen the soil of contemplative thought; they are swords against the enemies: such words are weapons" (145). The invocation of "enemies" might cue us to think about Schmitt's paradigm as a whole, but it corresponds most closely with the forms it takes internal to a state. The situation implicit in Weber's scenario is one in which the political speech he's proscribing could conceivably go either way, in which both parties presumably are able speak, indicating an internal political conflict, and are liable to speak out given a public platform, indicating a particularly *contentious* internal political conflict. In other words, it approaches the extremely divided conditions Schmitt describes in which the state/outside antagonism is replaced by internal antagonisms (32). 

Weber could on one hand be taken as a kind of confirmation of Schmitt's insights. The extent to which the friend-enemy structure, and thus the possibility of violence, always underlies politics can be seen in his explanation: reversing the swords-into-plowshares metaphor, the most peaceful-seeming agitations in "words" become "weapons." And yet something else more complicated is happening rhetorically here in which, through structural repetition and implication, scientific analysis becomes aligned with growth and productivity in contradistinction to political activity's alignment with weaponry. The "growth" metaphor is clear in its relation to the rest of Weber's system: his lecturer is in the business of giving concepts with which to think, leading the students out of the Platonic cave. But the other side of the metaphor suggests that the speech in the political meeting is in some way the reverse of this scientific horizon-widening, a mode of speech which actually reduces thought to the merely partisan. This seems something other than a distinction, as one might expect to still hear today, between teaching students to think and teaching them *what* to think. It seems rather to refer to the same reduction that Schmitt sees as inherent to all politics, that of thought to a single question of "friend-and-enemy…regardless of which human motives are sufficiently strong to have brought it about" (36). Political thought becomes a kind of violence to thought itself *by* thought itself: considering a political situation leads to judgment, which eliminates everything that has led to that judgment in the act of accepting it. If, however, Weber does indeed have a similar equation of even internal politics with friend-enemy divisions and the possibility of violence, and if political speech becomes a sort of violence in itself, there can be no informed political discussion and no non-violent political action. So it is that "academic prophecy…will create only fanatical sects but never a genuine community" in his system, since community can only come about through a somehow-preexisting consensus and not the violence of political development through dialogue (155). The implications of this statement, though, are hardly optimistic: the only choices look like a kind of consensus to conservatism or endless struggle.
