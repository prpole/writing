In this moment, in which the meanings and uses of the "species" concept are again on the table for discussion in ecocritical and postcolonial discourses, I want to reconsider Marx's concept of species-being. More specifically, I want to ask how Marx's discussion of species-being in *The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844*, which culminate dramatically in the statement, "History is the natural history of man," can be redeployed in the context of his Hegelianism as well as recent interventions on the topic. I expect to argue that in these relatively short passages, Marx yokes the human essence to the power to transform nature and, through nature, the self, thus establishing species as a mutable concept. But in linking species with the semi-Hegelian concept of history he puts forward in the rest of the text, Marx also suggests that species-being in humans is responsive to historical shifts in the means of production. Thus, species is rendered in terms of a kind of historically contingent prosthesis of changing technologies, and of objects, onto the essence of species, thereby changing that essence. This contingency of the species, though, would seem to allow for different relations to production and division of labor to be considered as speciation: thus specialization, through prosthesis, becomes in Marx something like a form of speciation.


Most of the species-being that gets discussed in these passages is in terms of something already lost. Species-being is the expense of alienation, the working on the self and working on the species that is replaced by "external" or estranged labor for another person---life comes to be replaced by the means of living, ie a living wage. But this draws out in the negative the concept of an intact species-being, one whose work "takes the species as its object" and "treats himself as the species." The individual human works not for self, and not as a means of life, but actually for the species. When we think of the statement, then, "History is the true natural history of man," we have to remember the Hegelian/Marxian concept of history as Aufhebung, and the more specifically Marxian conception of one historical era transcending the next in part through revolutionizing the means of production. This revolutionizing of the means of production is, in a sense, the work on the species and the basis for the idea of prosthesis.

On one hand this makes Marx's view of species-being potentially useful for new discussions of species in a post-anthropocentric and sort of post-postivist lens. I'm especially interested in quick, contextualizing engagements with three thinkers: Donna Haraway, Bill Brown, and Pablo Mukherjee (Postcolonial Environments). There is also probably something to be said via J. B. Foster and Jason Moore. But I want to look a little more closely into the background of Marxist criticism as well, particularly Erich Fromm's *Marx's Concept of Man*, and see how this stuff would interact with the more contemporary paradigms.

So maybe:

Intro: Is species up for further debate again, and where is Marx in that?
1. The Estrangement/Alienation passages; external labor versus life, the negatively-rendered intact species-being
2. The more Hegelian/Historical passage; "History is the True Natural History of Man"; Aufhebung, transcendence, and speciation; what happens to species in a Marxist historical framework based on this phrase
3. New Species Talk vs. Marxisms; where this would stand; the cyborg and prosthesis as a model of speciation; division of labor and prosthesis/speciation
