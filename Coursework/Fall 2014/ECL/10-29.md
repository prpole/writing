Sam Martin
	
	- pro-slavery
	- Snake imagery on first page: othering, also Africa land of devilry
	- using the language of liberty and tyrrany to defend the practice of slavery
	- argument that slaves are free from being pressed into service
	- but let's recall that folks are pressed into service to protect the empire
	- slaves have it bad but sailors have it worse: therefore we can justify slavery? but wait, the soldiers/sailors are needed because slavery enables empire
	- marshalls the rhetoric of revolution really insistently in teh final pages
	- abolition of African slavery is the enslavement of the british...?

Falconbridge

	- between american and french revs
	- Josiah Wedgewood---Darwin's grandpa!---
	- 1772 Mansfield Decision, no slavery on British soil, but does not abolish slavery. 
	- The medallion on the frontispiece would indicate immediately as a mark of an abolitionist text
	- experience held up as a category that trumps all others; but experience of course is not related completely independent of rhetoricp
	- using the language of liberty and commercial language in Martin, but here we have a rhetoric of sympathy; and in what ways is sympathy/emotion elicited  
	- sympathetic effect fo uncle tom's cabin based on the domestic sphere

	some moments: 

	- 18: fictionality and nonfictionality, repetition of the story of Oroonoko, maybe it happened twice but note how he underscores the eyewitness account thing, also interesting: this is a full century after oroonoko; 
	- the end: 48: goes from slaves to sailors, same move sammy martin makes above, so why rhetorically would this happen?
