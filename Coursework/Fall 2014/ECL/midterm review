Topics

Vision/Perception/Eyes
	- Ligon, 15-17; Ligon is a painter, therefore has a justifiable interest in beauty, despite his age etc. The beauty of the women in question reverse the perceiver/perceived binary thing (think Sartre), they ravish HIM by being beautiful, apparently; phallogocentrism comes about in response to their being no "culture" on the island, that comes to focus on the women
	- Oroonoko; gazes: multiple, of Oroonoko himself, depicted as piercing, intelligent, the awareness of being seen by this person; of Aphra Behn's narration, sexualizing, statue-making, aestheticizing (cf Ligon), a gaze the action of which is made narrative by the dissection of Oroonoko at novel's end (reduction to parts reverses prosopopoetic conjuration of his initial physical description); kind of tripled in the distancing measures of Omoinda's narration - also culture in the written spoken dyad
	- Hans Sloane and the visibilizing logic of epistemology; making new subjectivities through taxonomy; but also visibilizing certain things thru categorization

Slave revolt
   Cacklogallinia-maroon war; escaped slaves depicted as militarily sophisticated according to their knowledge of the lay of the land and their ambush, but simultaneously as "savage," at least insofar as they use hatchets rather than guns to kill the narrator's companions; also an interesting exchange of acts of mercy in which some kind of civilization/personhood appears conferred on the maroons insofar as they are able to and interested in confering mercy; mastery through mercy, hmm

   Orooonoko - slave revolt angle; raising of oroonoko to the status of a king with caesar brings slave revolts potentially back into consideration as honorable warfare, especially considering his (non-European) royal origins and his social status/natural courteousness (place in a courlty society); so the thing in which slavery is legal after a legal victory in war is reversed and through war slavery can be legally undone
	

Labor

- order; cultivation as a kind of aesthetic, aesthetics needing in some way to mirror the topic; frequent apologies to the muse for needing to write about shit and compost. Emphasizes cultivation without overcultivation, seeming to suggest at one point that not respecting the nutrients of the soil could lead to the entire new world going to france. Don't forget that this is a georgic, meaning labor, but labor is weirdly invisible. Order as act of mind, racist logocentrism and association of labor force with body. 

Texts

Bartolome de las Casas, *Tears of the Indians*. 1656. 
	- Note, interesting feature of translation: reappropriated for 17th c british consumption in translation, where De las Casas's point regarding the non-Christian behavior of Christinas (c.f. Tryon here!) is reworked to be the atrocities of Spanish rule; preparing for a justification of British ousting of Spanish from new world
	- Rhetorical use of monstrosity: heavy focus on the depiction of violence to children. Esp. remember the depiction of violence to pregnant women--to Catholics, these souls are unsaved. 

** 
Richard Ligon, *True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados*, 1657
	- vision; Ligon is a painter, therefore has a justifiable interest in beauty, despite his age etc. The beauty of the women in question reverse the perceiver/perceived binary thing (think Sartre), they ravish HIM by being beautiful, apparently; phallogocentrism comes about in response to their being no "culture" on the island, that comes to focus on the women
	- slavery; the moment when Ligon is not allowed to convert enslaved Africans because then they couldn't continue to be slaves; therefore the doublebind of prentending africans are inferiorbecause they don't have religion or culture, therefore justifying slavery, while simultaneously denying them the ability to convert/assimilate
	- slave revolt; one instance in which a slave plot is foiled by someone blabbing. In this case it appears to be one of the conspirators who tells out of some kind of affection for the slave owners
	- concludes with a guide for managing and running a sugar plantation; reveals the purpose fo the entire thing, and also serves as a justification for the venture; reveals the resource logic inherent in the entire narrative

Henry Neville, *The Isle of the Pines*, 1668

Thomas Tryon, *Friendly advice to the gentleman planters of the east and west indies* 1684
	- Heavy on the nominal-Christian-only line of argument. Interesting embodiment of thought/action/speech thing. Despite not being abolitionist heavily critical of the means of justifying slavery (in combination with hypocrisy)

**
Aphra Behn, *Oroonoko*, 1688
	- Oroonoko depicted as basically an ideal European in all matters except skin color---even other physical features are neoclassical-statuesque, roman nose, etc. Interestingly Oroonoko's knowledge seems to come from hearing, giving his knowledge a trait of orality that contrasts the written learnedness of the actual europeans. Also makes him a kind of courtly figure, extremely social, natural leader, foreshadowing his later re-naming as Caesar
	- gaze; multiple, of Oroonoko himself, depicted as piercing, intelligent, the awareness of being seen by this person; of Aphra Behn's narration, sexualizing, statue-making, aestheticizing (cf Ligon), a gaze the action of which is made narrative by the dissection of Oroonoko at novel's end (reduction to parts reverses prosopopoetic conjuration of his initial physical description); kind of tripled in the distancing measures of Omoinda's narration
	- slave revolt angle; raising of oroonoko to the status of a king with caesar brings slave revolts potentially back into consideration as honorable warfare, especially considering his (non-European) royal origins and his social status/natural courteousness (place in a courlty society); so the thing in which slavery is legal after a legal victory in war is reversed and through war slavery can be legally undone

Hans Sloane, *Voyage to the Islands of Madera et al.* 1707
	- episode: Emmanuel pretending to be sick; threat to Sloane's thing is what if someone's lying about their illness or about being ill; positions himself also as the observer who can detect fraud; does the same thing regarding women who think they're pregnant and are trying to trick him into giving them an abortion
	- cataloguing impulse of the natural history expresses itself in terms of cataloguing peoples 
	- human body responds the same way to different treatments regardless of race

**
Samuel Brunt, *Voyage to Cacklogallinia*, 1727
	- maroon war; escaped slaves depicted as militarily sophisticated according to their knowledge of the lay of the land and their ambush, but simultaneously as "savage," at least insoCfar as they use hatchets rather than guns to kill the narrator's companions; also an interesting exchange of acts of mercy in which some kind of civilization/personhood appears conferred on the maroons insofar as they are able to and interested in confering mercy; mastery through mercy, hmm
	- use of dialects to confer authenticity; not that the dialects are authentic, but this is a narrative conceit that is partially mocked by its extension to the giant chickens; satire on the travel narrative and satire of the idea of authenticity, exposure of it as a narrative fiction, but also a development of fictionality in general and narrative sophistication
	- also an exposure of the use of exploration as financial instrument; extent to which the colonies built europe, but also how investment organizes the geographic imaginary regarding new world colonies and caribbean islands

**
James Grainger, *The Sugar-Cane*, 1766
	- order; cultivation as a kind of aesthetic, aesthetics needing in some way to mirror the topic; frequent apologies to the muse for needing to write about shit and compost. Emphasizes cultivation without overcultivation, seeming to suggest at one point that not respecting the nutrients of the soil could lead to the entire new world going to france. Don't forget that this is a georgic, meaning labor, but labor is weirdly invisible. Order as act of mind, racist logocentrism and association of labor force with body. 

Edward Rushton, *West-Indian Eclogues*, 1787
	- depictions of laborers in dialogue and violence, for violence see tryon and oroonoko
