Note: I may have gone slightly overboard here again, wordcount-wise. Opportunities to write about SF are few and far between!

I'd like to put *District 9* in some science-fictional context, primarily because, as with many contemporary SF blockbusters, the film is drawing on a generic reservoir of images and associations that precedes it by many decades---*Her* is another recent example, arguably just repackaging a host of older AI narratives (along with many of their problems) in the smooth veneer of an Apple-like product. In this case, *District 9*'s revitalization of the well-trod insectoid-extraterrestrial ground provides a useful context for its treatment of the contact zones between slums and "civilized" space. The older points of the "insectoid" lineage, at least as far back as I know it, arise in the height and aftermath of the Cold War and often consist in uncomfortable, antiquated equations of species (and through it race) with social structure. The patriarch of uncomfortable, antiquated equations, Robert A. Heinlein, provides at least two examples in *Starship Troopers*[^1] and *The Puppet Masters*: in the two novels, insectoid extraterrestrials stand in for something like communism despite acting within a strict, militaristic hierarchy. Another, sometimes related thread of the insect trope is the parasite narrative, which often appears as a way of getting at political "brainwashing" or ideological control---*The Puppet Masters* also falls into this category, and is pretty clearly an artifact of McCarthyism. 

A more nuanced take on the parasite trope, and one that is more relevant to slums in general and *District 9* in particular, is Octavia Butler's "Bloodchild", a short story in which the young protagonist is part of a small community of humans on a planet of parasitic insectoids who plant eggs in domesticated host animals. The humans in question are revealed to have fled persecution on Earth, landed on the planet, begun and lost a war, and been maintained as livestock until it became clear that they made better hosts when kept in "preserves" like the one the protagonist finds himself in. Where the parasite trope can easily fall into the mold of "jobless parasite on the welfare state"---and it often does in contemporary political rhetoric---here it takes its diametrically opposite, almost leftist use, that of something like the "rentier" class or aristocracy "feeding" on the labor of the poor. In her afterword to the story, Butler says that among other things she "tried to write a story about paying the rent…. Sooner or later, the humans would have to make some kind of accomodation with their um... their hosts. Chances are this would be an unusual acoomodation" (31-2). Though it would be incorrect to call the preservation in Butler's story a slum, there are certainly resonances with the apartheid as it is represented in Gordimer's foreward to *The Discarded People*: that "South Africa is…absolute control by a minority over a vital labour-force majority"; what is such a relationship if not parasitic? (xiv). And certainly, the justification of human "preservations," achieved through the representation of humans as basically animal *by* something a human might consider as animal, models the contingency of species as a category and its usefulness in justifying the marginalization and containment of Others, as Huggan and Tiffin show in their introduction. Such uses of speciation come into rhetorical focus when the entities doing the containment are literally parasites.

What use, then, does *District 9* make of this rich lineage of insectoid-extraterrestrial narratives? The film makes brief gestures at the first paradigm I mentioned, as if to acknowledge it while setting it aside: there is passing reference to the "prawns" not having a sense of property in the way we do, and with the obvious exception of the leading "prawn" character they appear to demonstrate almost no independent thought outside of catfood except when one of the "pack" is threatened, despite (in a bizarre unresolved contradiction) apparently being able to build spaceships. The parasite paradigm is somewhat more central, with Wickus's metamorphosis perhaps elaborating the trope into a model of empathy and a brief episode in which a cow is used as a host animal for larval "prawns." *District 9*, though, in extending trope to the context of the slum, discloses and literalizes the conception of the slum as a site of filth and contamination as Ghertner describes it. Here ,the insect figure brings with it the associations with infestation, filth, and even contaminants; but astoundingly, these associations are relocated *away* from the insect body of the prawns and onto their living conditions and social structures---the areas in which their situation most closely corresponds to actually existing slums. The human characters are oddly unphased by the prawns' insectoid corporeality, but they *are* disgusted by their trade in weapons and violation of building codes. This relocation of disgust might fruitfully be understood according to Ghertner's concept of the slum as "nuisance": the divergence from a desired vision of the city is what makes slums "filthy" and in need of purification, not the observable or measurable state of things. The insectoid of *District 9*, then, in contrast and addition to the paradigms described above, becomes less a figure in its own right than a filter through which the already existing conception of the slum is brought into focus, and by means of which viewers are asked to interrogate their own, already existing revulsion to the environment it depicts.
