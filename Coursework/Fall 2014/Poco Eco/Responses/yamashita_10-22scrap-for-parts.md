*Through the Arc of the Rain Forest* is a novel in constant motion. This is true in terms of the narrative structure: five or so narrative trajectories are established in five different locations at the novel's beginning; by the end of the first chapter of each thread, its characters are moving, and almost all remain in global circulation until they converge on the Matacão. But *within* each narrative, images of circulation also abound. Kazumasa's gift keeps him riding the circuit of various trains or searching for Matacão deposits somehow as an employee even when he is independently wealthy. Chico Paco's pilgrimages keep him in circling to and from the Matacão, either doing so himself or through others on his behalf, creating a votive network of constant motion. Batista and Tania similarly globalize communication and, thus, marketing through their pigeon business and their own related travels. Mané Pena, himself the most rooted of characters, is drawn into the circuit of global trade in his accidental creation of a commodity craze in the feather. And finally, most pointedly, the GGG-and-J. B. Tweep thread demonstrates the centrality of constant circulation---even, to put it more strongly, the *sufficiency* of constant circulation---to global capitalism. Through her presentation of the constant motion of so many unexpected and insinginifcant objects, Karen Tei Yamashita narrates the lived experience of the human and "more-than-human" (the ball narrator, the pigeons) becoming imbricated with the market itself: while conceding the immateriality of so much that is so important to the functioning of the world, she nevertheless establishes the material substratum as that which is essential to (even determinate of) vitality.

It is no coincidence that as the rate or scope of movement increases, so does the income of each character, nor that movement is always in some way initiated by the monetization of the peculiar object-appendages[^1] each character possesses. 

What is most remarkable about Yamashita's approach to the thing, though, is its treatment of detritus as a possible site in which multiple systems of value and knowledge come together, and through this treatment, her unremitting focus on materiality---in this sense, it might be brought into focus through Bill Brown's "sense of things" or Stacy Alaimo's. By becoming subject to the temporality and valuation of the market, for example, Mané Pena's feathers transcend the temporality of human use in which they initially appear, entering the immediacy of consumer gratification and the permanence of the evolutionary timescale (through extinction of the birds) in the same gesture. Similarly, several temporalities inhere in Kazumasa's ball, which has a similar "trialectic" function of the individual temporality, the market/commodity temporality, and the geological temporality insofar as it contributes to the elimination of the consolidated pollution of the Matacão deposits. Ultimately, this multiplicity of temporalities resolves in an either optimistic or apocalyptic return to a pre-market state of liesure, and on top of it the elimination of decades of pollution. Not considering the feathers as organic matter, as body, leads to a rampant avian plague, and further inattention in the plague's treatment leads to the birds' mass extinction. Nevertheless, though these and the other objects gradually disappear (in one case literally melting into air), the world returns to contendedness with material: the novel finally presents a view of capitalist despoliation eating its own tail, extractive production and wasteful consumption balancing each other out, and the markets finally pick up and leave.[^3] The waste product of consumerism feeds the fire of endless growth, the circuit of commodity circulation is closed again, and much of the status quo is restored. But in the closing images of soccer pitches sprung up among toxic puddles, Yamashita leaves us with a sense of the insignificance of markets to the value systems that actually matter---birds, play, sustenance, and love, use-values that are able to remain in place and satisfy.


[^1]: At the risk of more listing (this novel almost demands litany): 

[^2]: As initial source material for this admittedly bizarre reference (though perhaps no more bizarre than commodity trading itself), see Eddie Murphy's 1983 film *Trading Places* and the related episode 471 of the Planet Money podcast.

[^3]: Recall prof. Wenzel's objection: it is not a reparation of the metabolic rift but a bacteria that eventually leads to the destruction of the Matacão. So a new way to present this would be: the crisis-prone nature of capital, with capital naturalized in this way as crisis-prone, becomes a narrative resolution through the filter of waste production. Waste production leads to rapid evolutionary development and social development and market development all at once; in this case massive circulation has a seedy underbelly of pathogen development; avian pathogen kills masses of humans and, secondarily, birs, but paradoxically the development of the Matacão pathogen only destroys "progress" itself in the form of Matacão. Circulation not only can exist without its object but tends to destroy the object/network on which it is based, in many circumstances; objections include Kazumasa's initial circulation with his ball and the infrastructural elements of that; also GGG seems to be a new kind of circulation in the same way that the pigeons are, maybe the issue here is development of global ciruculation -- counter to that would be Kazumasa and his cousin finding happiness due to their own global circulations.... But not only objet petit a of capital, also destruction of the object by the circulation it engenders.
