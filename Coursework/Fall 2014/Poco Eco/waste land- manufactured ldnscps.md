##waste land

use verus exchange exists here; houses built out of refuse but there is a commodity trade in cast-out things as well

organization as the primary mode of labor; what can't be automated relies on a large and cheap labor source who isn't picky

aestheticizing something in order to change it; aestheticizing as destruction; representing something in the hopes that it will no longer be, being proud of the thing you're trying to destroy

invisibility and the landfill; end of the line being the place that doesn't have anywhere to send their trash; matacao and the virgin land idea---"naturally" migrates to the "virgin" area; prostitution as clean immoral work, trash picking as dirty moral work;

artistic representation vs political represenation; feedback loop of representability; imago and self-representation

goal of being recognized as part of the recycling/trash collecting sector; c.f. Moore: what role are communities like this filling in the global economy, and what would happen---to them or to the world---if they weren't doing it?

1. the concept of the "end of the line" : import Harvey's "spatial fix" as Moore does, and you get a coincidence of having no place left to put garbage and people who are filling the last "legitimate" (i.e. non-criminal) economic niche. Nevertheless the picker industry leads to specialization and professionalization like any other industry, and the "end of the line" means that nobody else is even bothering to exploit the labor in a Marxian sense. So you get labor organized by community (at least as shown by the documentary) and democratic political organization/representation. End of the line as a free zone, but the only zones allowed to be free are those that are almost unendurable.

2. in glorifying individuals with "personality" it seems that there's a sense of those who are worthy/hard-working being able to pull themselves out of their situation, while those not chosen for the documentary are ignored. Can't really fault it in that you need to do certain things to make a documentary/make a coherent narrative, but on the other hand it seems to reinforce a bootstrapping ideology that is never going to be true. Similarly the idea that by seeing the rest of the world these people will get the right mindset to just up and leave, as though it's a simple thing to do. (Lest we forget that Vik Muniz's departure was contingent on getting a windfall, no matter how miserably that windfall was attained.)

3. Aesthetic representation is related to political representation through the idea of what is representable. Just as trash is considered worthless and an unsuitable material for artistic use, certain groups are considered unsuitable material for political representation and certain locations are considered *suitable* for dumping. Bringing people and things into different types of circulation exposes both the system and the people on the wrong end of it, and exposure is a precondition of change.



##Manufactured Landscapes (Edward Burtinsky)

1. e-waste recyclers. e-waste recycling poisons the water table of the communities built on that recycling even though it nominally reduces "waste". To what extent, following Yaeger, are these categories of recyclability and waste simply arbitrary semi-legalistic semi-capitalist definitions, matters of re-materializaiton as commodities? Is recycling good for the globe of local ecologies or is it good for markets? What are the advantages of re-using, what is unreusable, and what alternatives are there (some other kind of destruction)? The image of the hammers knocking the metal braces off the plastic/chip boards: how much is actually reusable, and what other types of reuse are there?

2. seems to be an obvious danger in saying, "Humans come from nature, therefore what humans do to 'nature' is just nature doing unto itself"; c.f. Marx via Mukherjee, human changing of nature is one of nature's forces changing itself. Because this is pure semantics, pure representation, and it is possible for internal workings of a system to result in negative outcomes for that system. i.e. the idea that anything that happens within the rules of a system, within the rules of "nature," will be beneficial to the system in which it occurs, seems like a romantic idealization of what is natural and potentially catastrophic. Is it possible for a bacteria to come about naturally that would destroy everything on the planet, and finally itself? Surely yes. And would we understand this as good-because-inside-the-system because it arose out of that system?

3. Attempts to represent two unrepresentables, though those two are unrepresentable for different reasons. 1. depicting 'despoliation' as nature, formerly unrepresentable because it kind of pleases none, is an unworthy material destroying the worthy material (trash destroying nature). Nevertheless relies on a more basic aesthetics to destablize those whole "Enlightenment" categories, c.f. Yaeger. 2. Representing the incomprehensible system: the silver mines shot on silver film, the ship got to using the products of perhaps that very ship. Depicting the global division of labor itself, following Wallerstein et al. Specialization at its most extreme and the underside of the "chain of convenience" that permits the usually-depicted life to exist. The real subject matter of these photographs is always the system that contains the things photographed, it seems. The challenge of representation is making the thing depicted relatable to the life of the viewer, who is probably on the other side of that system.


Overriding questions: 

- what to make of aestheticizing the thing that aestheticizing means to undercut/destroy? Aestheticizing as exposing, or claiming to be only exposing, when the thing that is exposed is still being understood as a problem.
