# Sections
one hashtag is a section, and to emphasize, which translates as italics, use an *asterisk*
But though and if you want to write like everyone's favorite maximalist,^[I'm talking about David Foster Wallace.] use carrots and enclose in brackets

##links
to use links do it like [this](www.dudewheresmycar.com)

##bold
**double** emphasis means bold

##lists
- **whoa** like whoa
- **doublewhoa** like seriously
