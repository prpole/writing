	annote = {Capta is not an expression of idiosyncracy, emotion, or individual quirks, but a systematic expression of information understood as constructed, as phenomena perceived according to principles of interpretation. To do this, we need to conceive of every metric "as a factor of X", where X is a point of view, agenda, assumption, presumption, or simply a convention.},
	annote = {Perhaps the most striking feature distinguishing humanistic, interpretative, and constructivist graphical expressions from realist statistical graphics is that the curves, bars, columns, percentage values would not always be represented as discrete bounded entities, but as conditional expressions of interpretative parameters–a kind of visual fuzzy logic or graphical complexity.},
	annote = {the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a "picture" of "data".},
	annote = {The basic principle underlying such graphical displays is that capta marks its interpreted status. Interpreted knowledge is situated, observer co-dependent, and partial. Its variables are, in theory, infinite, but they are always present in some degree or measure by virtue of the performative and participatory character of interpretative information. Interpretation depends upon and is an expression of an individual reading in a particular set of circumstances and never presumes to completeness or observer independence.},
	annote = {the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework on which the statistical data were {constructed.The} graphical force conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no "data" pre-exist their parameterization. Data are capta, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it.},

"not in its character of {TruthTeller}, but for the Beauty that abounds in its Truth ; con stituting it true" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:11)
"no such thing as demonstration" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:14)
{"My} general proposition, then, is this : In the Original Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:14)
"conceivable" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:14)
"that can be imagined" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:14)
"by the term " Universe," wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I mean to de signate the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:14)
{"The} Earth would be con sidered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view, becomes mankind ; mankind a member of the cosmical family of Intelligences." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:16)
{"No} man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:18)
{"All} at tempts at generalization were met at once by the words 'theoretical,' 'theory,' 'theorist' all thought, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to them selves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:20)
"were more wretchedly helpless" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:20)
{"Ability} or inability to conceive/ says Mr. Mill very properly, ' is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth/ Now" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:21)
"if an axiom there be, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom that no more absolute axiom is" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:22)
"the straightest and most available of all mere roads the great thoroughfare the majestic highway of the Consistent ? Is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vitally momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth ?" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:24)
{"I} grasped it with my soul I reached it through mere dint of intuition." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:26)
Aetna from before? (note on p.27)
 
"individual Universe it is clear that a descent to small from great to the outskirts from the centre (if we could establish a centre) to the end from the beginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:28)
{"It} stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:29)
"alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition. " The mind is impelled/' say the theologians and others, " to admit a First Cause, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end."" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:31)
{"In} fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:34)
"at some point of Space which we will take as a centre at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:35)
{"It} is but the conviction arising from those induc tions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude pur reason, or defy our capacity of expression." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:35)
"that what God originally created that that Matter which, by dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from Nihility, could have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceiv able state of what ? of Simplicity ?" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:35)
{"Oneness}, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created Matter ; but I propose to show that this Oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the con stitution, the existing phenomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material Universe." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:36)
"diffusion from Unity, under the conditions, involves" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:36)
"a tendency to return into Unity" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:37)
Reversing entropy (note on p.37)
 
Dense (note on p.37)
 
{"The} assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes that of infinite divisibility" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:37)
"that which I have suggested the design of variety out of unity diversity out of sameness heterogeneity out of homogeneity complexity out of simplicity in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatic ally irrelative One" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:38)
{"The} repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, only up to a certain epoch" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:40)
See Coleridge and magnetism (note on p.42)
 
{"Discarding} now the two equivocal terms, " gravitation " and "electricity," let us adopt the more definite expres sions, " attraction " and " repulsion." The former is the body ; the latter the soul : the one is the material ; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. No other principles exist." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:43)
"the Universe" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:43)
"sole properties through which we perceive" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:43)
"ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to enter tain in any effort at grasping the great principle, Attraction." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:49)
{"In} a word, is it not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even more than together is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were One" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:49)
"because originally, and therefore normally, they were One that now, in all circumstances at all points in all directions by all modes of approach in all relations and through all conditions they struggle back to this absolute ly, this irrelatively, this unconditionally one ?" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:49)
{"They} all tend rectilinearly towards a cen tre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:50)
{"Here}, indeed, it is clear that he must have adventured in search of the treasure : that he did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide, Imagina tion, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to direct him aright." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:54)
{"Now} a connec tion between these two ideas unity and diffusion cannot be established unless through the entertainment of a third idea that of irradiation." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:55)
{"When} these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force or a second and inferior force of the same character emits, in the same manner that is to say, by irradiation as before a second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:61)
"the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:63)
"most directly to its real and essential centre, Unity the absolute and final Union of all." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:64)
{"The} absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the Volition of God, must have been in a condition of positive normality, or rightfulness for wrongfulness implies rela tion" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:64)
{"Reaction} is the return from the condition of as it is and ought not to be into the condition of as it was, ori ginally, and therefore ought to be" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:65)
{"I} reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of " an unwarranted assumption " on the part of the objector the assumption of a principle, in Dynamics, at an epoch when no " principles," in anyttmig, exist : I use the word " principle," of course, in the objector's understanding of the word." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:68)
{"The} primary act that of Irradiation from Unity must have been independent of all that which the world now calls " principle "" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:68)
{"Thus} the two Principles Proper, Attraction and Repul sion the Material and the Spiritual accompany each other, in the strictest fellowship, forever. Thus The Body and The Soul walk hand in hand." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:76)
"but it by no means follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:84)
{"From} whatever point we regard it, we shall find it beautifully true. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, not to possess Truth as its essentiality" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:84)
{"On} the Melville islands to adduce merely one out of a hundred examples we find traces of ultra-tropical vege tation of plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any portion of the surface of the Earth. Is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subse quent to the whirling-off of Venus ?" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:89)
{"In} speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, I remarked that " the important phenomena of vitality, consciousness, and thought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous."*" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:90)
"perceive that not merely the manifestation of vitality, but its importance, consequence, and elevation of character, keep pace, very closely, with the heterogeneity, or com plexity, of the animal structure." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:91)
{"Our} solar system" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:100)
"is now to be considered as an example of the innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout the Universal Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:100)
{"Volition"} (Poe and Leavitt 1848:100)
"we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the end" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:100)
{"Regarding} all, then, as but colossal atoms, each" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:101)
{"I} am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful threshold of the Future. For the present, calling these assemblages " clusters," we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation. Their absolute consolidation is to come." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:101)
{"There} has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the shape of the Galaxy ; which, in nearly all our astro nomical treatises, is said to resemble that of a capital Y." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:103)
{"The} cluster in question has, in reality, a certain general very general resemblance to the planet Saturn, with its" (Poe and Leavitt 1848:103)
"encompassing triple ring." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:104)
{"The} surrounding 'ring, where it ap proaches our position, has in it a longitudinal gash, which does, in fact, cause the ring, in our vicinity, to assume, loosely, the appearance of a capital Y." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:104)
{"Were} the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the Galaxy since there could be absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star." (Poe and Leavitt 1848:106)},

	abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.
Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

Against the grain of such critical historicism, I want to articulate and defend two related propositions: 1 that history is not a box-that conventional models of historicizing and contextualizing prove deficient in accounting for the transtemporal movement and affective resonance of particular texts-and 2 that in doing better justice to this transtemporal impact, we might usefully think of texts as "nonhuman actors"-a claim that, as we'll see, requires us to revise prevailing views about the heroic, self-propelling, or oppositional nature of agency and to ponder the links between agency and attachment.},

(Derrida {1978:1)"The} center is at the center of the totality, and yet, since the center does not belong to the totality (is not part of the totality), the totality has its center elsewhere" (Derrida 1978:2)"archeology, like that of any eschatology, is an accomplice of this reduction of the structuralality of structure and always attempts to conceive of structure from the basis of a full presence which is out of play" (Derrida {1978:2)"This} moment was that in which language invaded the universal problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything became discourse—provided we can agree on this word—that is to say, when everything became a system where the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of differences." (Derrida {1978:3)"The} absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and the interplay of signification ad infinitum." (Derrida {1978:3)"The} absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and the interplay of signification ad infinitum" (Derrida 1978:3)"cannot make us forget that the concept of the sign cannot in itself surpass or bypass this opposition between the sensible and the intelligible." (Derrida {1978:4)"For} there are two heterogenous ways of erasing the difference between the signifier and the signified: one, the classic way, consists in reducing or deriving the signifier, that is to say, ultimately in submitting the sign to thought; the other, the one we are using here against the first one, consists in putting into question the system in which the preceding reduction functioned: first and foremost, the opposition between the sensible and the intelligible." (Derrida {1978:4)"Since} these concepts are not elements or atoms and since they are taken from a syntax and a system, every particular borrowing drags along with it the whole of metaphysics." (Derrida {1978:5)"It} is a question of putting expressly and systematically the problem of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources necessary of that heritage itself. A problem of economy and strategy." (Derrida {1978:6)"Obviously}, there is no scandal except in the interior of a system of concepts sanctioning the difference between nature and culture." (Derrida {1978:7)"For}, from the moment that the incest-prohibition can no longer be conceived within the nature/culture opposition, it can no longer be said that it is a scandalous fact, a nucleus of opacity within a network of transparent significations."

(Derrida 1978:7)"consists in conserving in the field of empirical discovery all these old concepts, while at the same time exposing here and there their limits, treating them as tools which can still be of use." (Derrida 1978:8)"there is a readiness to abandon them if necessary if other instruments should appear more useful." (Derrida {1978:8)Engineer} here constitutes the center (thus the structure) (note on {p.9)"On} the other hand, still in The Savage Mind, he presents as what he calls bricolage what might be called the discourse of this method. The bricoleur, says {LeviStrauss}, is someone who uses "the means at hand," that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary, or to try several of them at once, even if their form and their origin are heterogenous —- and so forth. There" (Derrida {1978:9)"A} subject who would supposedly be the absolute origin of his own discourse and would supposedly construct it "out of nothing," "out of whole cloth," would be the creator of the verbe, the verbe itself." (Derrida {1978:9)"From} the moment that we cease to believe in such an engineer" (Derrida 1978:9)"the very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning decomposes." (Derrida 1978:10)"what appears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of the discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a subject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute arche'." (Derrida {1978:10)"From} this point of view, the interest of the reference-myth does not depend on its typical character, but rather on its irregular position in the midst of a group." (Derrida 1978:11)"it is necessary to forego scientific or philosophical discourse, to renounce the episteme which absolutely requires, which is the absolute requirement that we go back to the source, to the center, to the founding basis, to the principle, and so on" (Derrida {1978:11)"It} must have the form of that of which it speaks" (Derrida {1978:11)"When} we think we have disentiangled them from each other and can hold them separate, it is only to realize that they are joining together again, in response to the attraction of unforeseen affinities." (Derrida {1978:11)"It} is by this absence of any real and fixed center of the mythical or mythological discourse that the musical model chosen by Levi Strauss for the composition of his book is apparently justified. The absence of a center is here the absence of a subject and the absence of an author" (Derrida {1978:12)"Music} and mythology bring man face to face with virtual objects whose shadow alone is actual. . . . Myths have no authors."" (Derrida {1978:12)"For} lack of expressly posing this problem, we condemn ourselves to transforming the claimed transgression of philosophy into an unperceived fault in the interior of the philosophical field. Empiricism would be the genus of which these faults would always be the species. Trans-philosophical concepts would be transformed into philosophical naivetes" (Derrida {1978:13)"On} the one hand, structuralism justly claims to be the critique of empiricism. But at the same time there is not a single book or study by Levi-Strauss which does not offer itself as an empirical essay which can always be completed or invalidated by new information." (Derrida 1978:13)"freeplay. If totalization no longer has any meaning, it is not because the infinity of a field cannot be covered by a finite glance or a finite discourse, but because the nature of the field—that is, language and a finite language—excludes totalization. This field is in fact that of freeplay, that is to say, a field of infinite substitutions in the closure of a finite ensemble." (Derrida 1978:14)"there is something missing from it: a center which arrests and founds the freeplay of substitutions. One could say—rigorously using that word whose scandalous signification is always obliterated in French—that this movement of the freeplay, permitted by the lack, the absence of a center or origin, is the movement of supplementarily." (Derrida {1978:14)"The} movement of signification adds something, which results in the fact that there is always more, but this addition is a floating one because it comes to perform a vicarious function, to supplement a lack on the part of the signified." (Derrida {1978:15)"This} distribution of a supplementary allowance" (Derrida 1978:15)"is absolutely necessary in order that on the whole the available signifier and the signified it aims at may remain in the relationship of complementarity which is the very condition of the use of symbolic thought." (Derrida {1978:15)"But} is it not precisely because it is none of these things that mana is a simple form, or more exactly, a symbol in the pure state, and therefore capable of becoming charged with any sort of symbolic content whatever?" (Derrida 1978:15)"symbolic content supplementary [my italics] to that with which the signified is already loaded," (Derrida {1978:16)"A} zero phoneme is opposed to all the other phonemes in French in that it entails no differential chararacters and no constant phonetic value. On the contrary, the proper function of the zero phoneme is to be opposed to phoneme absence." (R" (Derrida 1978:16)"the function of notions like mana is to be opposed to the absence of signification, without entailing by itself any particular signification." (Derrida 1978:16)"by reducing history, Levi-Strauss has treated as it deserves a concept which has always been in complicity with a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words, paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history could be opposed" (Derrida {1978:16)"One} can therefore describe what is peculiar to the structural organization only by not taking into account, in the very moment of this description, its past conditions: by failing to pose the problem of the passage from one structure to another, by putting history into parentheses. In this "structuralist" moment, the concepts of chance and discontinuity are indispensable." (Derrida {1978:17)"But}, in accordance with an act which was also Rousseau's and Husserl's, he must "brush aside all the facts" at the moment when he wishes to recapture the specificity of a structure" (Derrida {1978:17)Nostalgia} and the absent frontier in terms of this missing center? (note on p.18)", a natural interruption of the natural sequence, a brushing aside of nature." (Derrida {1978:18)"The} presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain." (Derrida 1978:18)"being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around" (Derrida {1978:18)"This} affirmation then determines the non-center otherwise than as loss of the center."
