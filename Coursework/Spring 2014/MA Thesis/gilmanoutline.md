#Gilman's Garden

I. World as home, city as garden
	A. Gilman and the garden city movement/housework communes
	B. spatial innovation as social innovation (progress rather than innov.?)
	C. narrative spatial rendering as social argument-idea of a full world leads to management and 2. 
	
II. The Garden of Evolution
	A. specialization as speciation
	B. social progress as evolution--education vs. inheritance (kindergarten)
	C. eugenics and "planting"--complicated relationship to culling
	D. competition - structural and thematic
	E. competition in Spencer et al.
	F. Gilman's relationship to social Darwinism
	G. total absence of market--capitalism as inherently competitive, ergo unresolvable, hence necessity of socialism for this social Darwinian construct
	
III. Gilman's Alternative Naturalism
	A. Formal/generic shift from adventure/exploration novel to the utopian genre
		1. competition cipher marks the shift
		2. awareness of garden upon return
		3. what appears to have been competition was entirely circumscribed by the society
	B. Comparison with defs. of naturalism, Pizer et al.
		1. replaces the individual struggle with social/biological determinism with societal struggle with historical, capitalist, and yes biological determinism
		2. idea of the adventure underlying everyday life is replaced by the potential for social progress underlying everyday life
	
developing argument: Gilman uses the garden to posit a social Darwinism that exists without competition, suggesting an anti-naturalist relationship to nature and evolutionary theory.

Gilman uses the idea of the garden to tie resource management and use of space to conscious development of society, eventually positing a form of social Darwinism that avoids and even precludes competition. This position is a powerful counterpoint to both the adventure narratives and literary naturalism that define contemporaneous responses to nature and evolutionary social theory.
