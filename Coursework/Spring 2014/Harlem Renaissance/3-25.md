Harlem Renaissance 3-25:

on the sense of life fostered by B. T. Washington
-based on the sort of pragmatic effect of things that Washington set up--number of schools based on his, etc.
-line from washington to Malcolm X? re self-sufficiency for example

women in Cane as Beatrice-like figures for Toomer

in the context of many other new movements going on; new poetry; American renaissance; the Irish renaissance

interesting to look at the earliest Harlem renaissance anthologies comparatively

Dawson--arranger for spirituals; people training singers in schools as well as churches

trains--train whistles in Jazz eg

railroad- work by james allen mcphearson

Sterling Brown - 1930s(?) *Southern Road*
-teaches people like Toni Morrison and Amiri Baraka
-poem on Jack Johnson
-seems like a pretty amazing person to investigate

Josephine Baker

Harlem in Montmartre-documentary on Baker

Parody: “she knows what you expect, and she’s giving you that with a little twist”

Baker was a presenter at the march on Washington

places Nina Simone next to Baker
