#France for African-American artists
-many get a taste for france and international life generally from service in WWII
-experience of France for Huggins--actually make you feel human instead of looking at you as though you might be a savage
-yet note ironies of N African French empire

#on blackface
-white performance tradition of early 19th c
-thomas rice, daniel emmett - white blackface performers
-not really related to any particular plantation history, if anything more related to old american folk archetypes (edwards)
-the “stage negro” as a figure arising out of 19th century white stock characters
-Baker imitates Hudgins in 1927 - 16:40 edwards on chains of impersonation
-black minstrelsy as the only way of getting onto the stage
-breaking from minstrelsy in the language of minstrelsy
-"double doubling” - blacks playing whites playing blacks
-Hudgins brulesqueing white performance of blackface, parody of white performers
-Burt Williams, George Walker---inception of the black theatrical tradition, and Williams is in blackface all the way through
-Wms and Walker performance called “Two Real Coons”
-performing the realness of the fictional figure “coon”
-Hudgins continues in blackface through the 1950s, even though it goes out of style more in late ‘20s
-black audiences went to Vaudeville blackface performances
-Hudgins always performed in silence

#Charleston
-Charleston hugely popular internationally
-Prince of Wales had Hudgins give him Charleston lessons

#Edwards’ impressions
-French concern that they were not having enough babies, “decline of the west”
-playful inversion of the French colonial dynamic
-Hudgins tries to copyright his act to prevent people from copying it
-some images in lecture
-pedagogy, who owns what, who has the right to teach are not incidental to the film
-not “innocent” questions
-note  that african explorer is wearing emblem of American minstrelsy
-Wms and Walker set shows in Africa in blackface, putting a fine point on the question
-paradoxical that the bakcward-looking costume is the uniform of black modernity? 
-"smuggled themselves into modernity through blackface”
-what is the gorilla doing in the film? doesn’t the gorilla change the relationship of the two characters? Betty Boop - coco is sometimes her boyfriend and sometimes dog; gorilla seems to be a paramour, competition maybe
