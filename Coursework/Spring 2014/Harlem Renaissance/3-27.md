the present becomes the origin that the primitive refers to; placing the perspective of the film one hundred years in the future is a way of considering the present as itself an origin of something. But it’s complicated that in order to make the present a primitive origin it needs to be destroyed. This origin question is complicated by the reversal of the student/professor role: Huggins is in a way, if not the origin, than the ultimate extension or embodiment of that dance, almost certainly the source or an influence on the white actress’s version. Primitivism also not so much the search for an origin as the projection of a speculative origin based on evidence in the present.
