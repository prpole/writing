Ope, looks like it’s Bearden!

Bearden, like Matisse, “draws with scissors”

distances himself from pathological views of community
“if you talk about Bearden, you have to talk about quilting”
Elizabeth Alexander on Bearden---repairing, quilting, history of one’s family incorporated

odyssey scenes my be Greek but they’re also universal--the logic of the african figure incorporated in his odyssey series

Ellington and Strayhorn Nutcracker Suite
influence of Vermeer, de Hoch, Jan Steen on Bearden -- “rectangles over rectangles”
