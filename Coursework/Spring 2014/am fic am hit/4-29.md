#Form#
-Attempt to distill the feeling of living in what will eventually be an historical moment
-Parataxis mimics the one-thing-leads-to-another logic associated especially with Philip’s father


#Historical Peanut Gallery#
-Edward A. Purcell, *The Crisis of Democratic Theory*, 1973; studying rejection of democratic government/theory in the turn of the 20th c.; divorce from theory; qualms over “government of laws rather than people”
-Holocaust didn’t exist as an idea while it was happening, exactly
-Peter Novick, 1999, *The Holocaust of American Life*
-Michael André Bernstein, “Victims-in-Waiting,” 1998; “backshadowing” as the reading-backwards of what will eventually happen into what is happening in the moments leading up to that event. E.g. everything in the 1930s comes to foreshadow the holocaust, or lead up to it in some way; upshot is that we judge people of the moment as though they should have known what was going to happen, just as we do
-Leslie Fiedler, “In Every Generation: A Meditation on the Two Holocausts,” 1989; is it possible to think that forced cultural assimilation (and thus elimination) as a kind of second “gentle” holocaust
