Notes from Am Fic/Am Hist, 3/25:

Styron, Day 2:

#Historical profession in 1960s#
-pivot point w/r/t slavery
	-Phillips, from part 1 of 20th c., the “familial” nature of slavery
	-Stampp, 1956, marks a break and a willingness to consider slave resistance as fight for freedom---continuation of the work of the am revolution
	-In part because of the decline in "scientific" racism
	-Civil rights activists are occasionally contributing to the historical profession
	-Note also that WWII complicates the racial purity thing, undercutting some of the justifications of racism
	-also the racial imbrication of the American forces in the war
	-David Brion Davis: *The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture*, 1967; Austin's recommendation; "ultimate limit of dehumanization"; largely white people wrestling with the contradictions of slavery
	-Eugene D. Genovese: *The World the Slaveholders Made*, 1969; Marxist/materialist take; there wasn't much white guilt because the South was an anti-modern, alternatiive civilization with an alternative reality and social order
	-Stanley Elkins: *Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life*, 1959; structural similarities between slavery and Nazism as perverted patriarchies
		-detachment - victims are entirely cut off from their previous lives and social context, hence identity; leads to dependence and thus obedience; foreign-making w/r/t previous context
		-closed systems - heavy discipline and complete partition from the outside world
		-infantilization ("Sambo") - closed system leads to a singl
	
#The Psychology of Nat Turner#
-Styron’s question: what happens to the mind under slavery?
-Gray’s question: what drives a slave to murder?
-Is Nat Turner an exceptional or a representative figure?
-Styron was apparently assuming that Nat Turner was crazy, or at least couldn’t have been rational; Styron’s thought is that he was rationalizing Turner in his account of him
-presenting Turner’s skepticism as a rationalizing move on Styron’s part
-but is Styron’s portrait actually that of a rational actor, or a figure somehow damaged and incomplete?
