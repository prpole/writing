#situation#
-1973, Nixon term 2 has just begun, Watergate is only just emerging
-novel announcing its ‘post-1960s’ moment 
-moment of post-modernism and “historiographical metafiction”
-general acknowledgement of the inventedness of historical narrative just like other narrative

#Narratives of Empire series#
-aspire to a total history of the American state
-overlapping characters and topoi à la Dos Pasos
-at what point did we cease being a republic and begin being an empire?
-which means: republic would safeguard from tyranny, both of the demos and the monarch and everything in between; empire seizes land and aggressively protects its interests and limits its citizenry
-centralization of power is the major concern here

#Vidal’s politics#
-not a partisan in that he pursues his principles regardless of any party affiliation
-dislikes both parties in his time
-very consciously trying NOT to read his own situation at the time of writing back into the period he’s writing about; essay called “*Burr*: The Historical Novel,” 2001

#Treatment of real and famous people#
-We’ve dealt with real people before
-Note that we’re only ever dealing with the major figures, Washington and Jefferson etc., through several levels of narrative mediation
-asserts motive, which is something Vidal says historians cannot do

#The Historical Peanut Gallery#
-Daniel J. Boorstin, 1953, *The Genius of American Politics*: is American politics exportable? no, because it is “not theoretical,” but is instead a pragmatic response to immanent circumstances; which is all of course horseshit, or at least at best a polite way of saying American politics is without principle and an uncomplicated shoring-up of power, in which case it’s probably on to something
-interesting: on the particular relevance of individual personality and biography in teh view of American political history
-“much of our self-criticism has taken the form of historical reinterpretation [of personalities]”
-hence the relevance of psychology to American historical study
-Richard Hofstadter, *The Paranoid Style of American Politics*, 1964: argues for the introduction of psychology into American historical study; political struggle is mroe than a rational pursuit of power, because it is driven by impulses and occasionally irrational behavior

#Real Burr#
-Aaron Burr actually did have this late confessional moment in which he dictates his memoirs to “set the record straight”

#Vidal’s Narration and Commentary#
-on debunking and bringing-down 
-foregrounding artificiality and misleading uses of language; begs one to ask what is and is not happening in order to question the validity/objectivity/possibility of either in historical narrative

#Austin’s argument#
-Burr is attacking history itself; attacking the story and narrative quality of history and the ways it has been expressed in language; Burr’s task as one of literary rebellion

#other#
-Wm Carlos Williams, *In the American Grain*, 1925

#historiographical metafiction#
-multimodal; archival; conspiratorial; capacious
-Austin says that he thinks all historical fiction is historiographical metafiction and the periodization it gets in the 80s does not go back far enough
