title: styron notes 4-1

Returning to controversy
eg factual inaccuracy
also question of conspiratorial support from publishing industry, audience, scholars, etc.

#deflation of nat turner#
-is Styron demythifying this figure or diminishing him?
-Turner’s force is brought low by a multiracial company, which is Styron’s invention
-Styron’s Gray uses this to suggest that the race is incapable of revolution
-Styron’s Turner corroborates to some extent, but posits that it is systemic in the sense of MLK’s “cut off someone’s legs and condemn him for being crippled” 

#Turner’s relationship with Margaret#
-problematic that black heroic figure is sexually attracted only to white women; but what is going on here despite a possible identification of captor with master
-also happens in Uncle Tom’s Cabin (non-sexually?) but that is a tenderness toward a child
-is Margaret trying to seduce Turner in the scene when he sees her in her “pantalettes”? and if so what does that say about Styron’s depiction of relationships between the races? 
-one possibility: she is actually defined by ‘thoughtlessness and innocence’ per Nat’s conjecture 
-but maybe she is a critique of a white person trying to come closer to, or come to understand as in Styron himself, and the difficulties therein; the insensitivity of initiating a romantic encounter, or provoking Turner to say that he would strike a white man who beat him
-‘she alone among all the white people I had ever talked to would have been artless enough to ask. Such a question no Negro should be forced into a position to answer, and because it was such a spirit of sympathy and innocence I resented her for it, now, somehow all the more.’
-relationship with Margaret leads us to a reading of Turner’s rebellion as a way of shaking white complacent innocence w/r/t race relations; making the Margarets of the world, as it were, understand the problems of their own 
-in the moment leading up to Margaret’s death both are completely silent, almost as if in tacit understanding of what is happening; double-register of their personal relationship and a racialized relationship?

#Turner- Ending illusions#
-end goal of his task is to end illusions of ethical behavior
-Styron: role of history in sustaining illusion: Travis lulled to sleep by the reassurance of history of apparent contentment among slaves; potential interpretation, avoid any historical narratives that reassure the white person who would be comforted out of discomfort; possibly also directed at those who would take Turner as a simplistically heroic figure

#Pushback continued
-that white writers should be called upon to evaluate the successful depiction of the black subject by a white subject is another level of the insult and pain
-'for no one else can speak out of the bittersweet bowels of our blackness’ Vincent Harding, *Ten Black Writers Respond*
-up to this point the idea of an insider perspective, privileging a subject position, would be considered unprofessional; the idea of a black or female epistemology arises at this point
-idea that ‘[black men] are only white men with black skins’ is recognized as condescending
