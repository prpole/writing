#treatment of the duel#
-historians say that Vidal’s depiction of the duel as certainly cuased by something gigantic and unknown is a pretty modern attitude, versus the 18th c. view of dueling in which it was very common

#Historical Peanut Gallery#
-Boorstin (*Genius of American Politics*) points out that the declaration was mostly aimed at economic matters and a very conservative document, an attempt to reinstate existing British law in the colonies
-Bernard Bailyn, *Ideological Origins of the American Revolution*, 1967; contra Boorstin; posits massive plot against liberty in England and America; elite cabal
-basic question between them: is it about economic calculations or ideological stands?
-Charles Beard, 1913: predecesor to Boorstin’s position ot some extent
-Edmund S. Morgan, *The American Revolution*, 1965

#Political Parties#
-recall Vidal’s not entirely sympathetic view of political parties
