#recall#
-Beloved as consensus novel
-"womanism”---a member of a certain (especially racial) group has a unique access to that experience, which is unable(?) to be discussed from outside of that group


#Treatment of Trauma and esp. Trauma of Slavery#
-odd from Morrison’s perspective that it’s the most widely read of her novels, given that nobody seems to want to remember it---national amnesia---universally painful
-Stamp Paid and the “unspeakable thoughts” of the women of 124---slavery as “ambient” 
-Rashomon effect
-Reason and “scientific method” (taxonomic method) applied to slavery may be not only inapplicable but distorting

#The ghost story, the occult#
-precedents: Magical realism, say, esp in the proportion of reality and the supernatural (say like 85/15)---as particularly useful for colonized/subjugated people, resistance to epistemological authority; or maybe appeal to the language of nightmares, thus the surreal

#Austin’s Argument#
-Beloved as the past itself, a legacy that the characters are navigating the remembering and forgetting of; the danger of engaging obsessively with history and not moving beyond (given that this is the mode in which nothing becomes quite a symbol

#sociological, socio-historical reading#
-recall the idea that the trauma of slavery is somehow contained in the family unit and its structure in the black community
-Is Morrison implicitly echoing the Moynehan report’s findings? Is she depicting the damaged family unit and its sociological effects?
-Paul D: internalizing the white gaze, doubled vision of himself; also depiction of the absent patriarchal figure, absent male/father; sexual perversity, sleeping with the daughter-figure of his partner
-logic of the home essentially re-inscribes the logic of slavery
-Is understanding/explaining slavery and its trauma a way of dealing with that trauma or a way of perpetuating it
