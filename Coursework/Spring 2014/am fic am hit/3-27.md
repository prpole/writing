picking up Turner’s rationality (Styron’s intention) vs the irrationality he claimed defines the historical figure; what about pathological readings?; recall the reading of slavery in terms of willful degradation of the victim, infantilization, id with the “master”, etc.; see notes from 3-25

when Turner refuses flight from Turner’s Mill, e.g.

#appeals to historical narrative
-on one hand thousand-year stuff is third-reichy
-on the other hand contextualizes black slavery in America in terms of Jewish slavery in Egypt; appeal includes portrait of Pharaoh as “white”
-identification with the past as constitutive of culture under slavery
-also following Elkins the way of relating to slavery in the present in some way defines the person of the present (?)

#responses
-*Ten Black Writers Respond* to Styron (1968)
-as portrait of victimhood; this victim as in turn reductive and emasculating; portrait of “failure”
-note for example the psychological register of Brown v Board of Ed.: non-material 
-and MLK Jr 1967, *Where Do We Go from Here?*: inferiority connects Jim Crow era to slavery
-and so the problem with the depiction of victimhood is that it contributes to these narratives of the natural domination and African inferiority
-defenses of the novel point out that it is systemically constructed and in some way inevitable
-understanding Styron’s project in terms of minimizing or criticizing militaristic racial self-assertion as a response to the Black Panther party
