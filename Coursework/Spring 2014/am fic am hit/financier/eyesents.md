 'His eyebrows were bushy , emphasizing vague , grayish-green eyes , and his hair was short and smooth and nicely parted .',

 'Mrs. Cowperwood was of a religious temperament -- a small woman , with light-brown hair and clear , brown eyes , who had been very attractive in her day , but had become rather prim and matter-of-fact and inclined to take very seriously the maternal care of her three sons and one daughter .',


 'He was a clean , stalky , shapely boy , with a bright , clean-cut , incisive face ; large , clear , gray eyes ; a wide forehead ; short , bristly , dark-brown hair .',

 'The latter , pale and waxy in texture , looking very much like pork fat or jade , moved about in torpedo fashion ; but his movements were apparently never out of the eyes of his enemy , for by degrees small portions of his body began to disappear , snapped off by the relentless claws of his pursuer .',


 "He was a brother of Mrs. Cowperwood 's -- Seneca Davis by name -- solid , unctuous , five feet ten in height , with a big , round body , a round , smooth head rather bald , a clear , ruddy complexion , blue eyes , and what little hair he had of a sandy hue .',




 "He had , somehow , in spite of himself , been impressed by the boy 's peculiar eye ; and now he felt , without knowing why , that the offer was probably legitimate enough , and that the boy had the money .',



 "He felt a keen desire to kiss her , and what might transpire at Ruth Merriam's party rose vividly before his eyes .',

 'Dora Fitter was a brunette , and Marjorie Stafford was as fair as the morning , with bright-red cheeks , bluish-gray eyes , and flaxen hair , and as plump as a partridge .',

 'His Uncle Seneca had allowed him to act as assistant weigher at the sugar-docks in Southwark , where three-hundred-pound bags were weighed into the government bonded warehouses under the eyes of United States inspectors .',


 "`` '' Yes , '' said George , a much leaner and slightly taller man , with dark , blurry , reflective eyes and a thin , largely vanished growth of brownish-black hair which contrasted strangely with the egg-shaped whiteness of his bald head .',




 'These two men he worked for were already nothing more than characters in his eyes -- their business significated itself .',

 '`` she asked , looking affectionately into his eyes .',

 'Her hair was the color of a dried English walnut , rich and plentiful , and her complexion waxen -- cream wax -- -with lips of faint pink , and eyes that varied from gray to blue and from gray to brown , according to the light in which you saw them .',

 'Rivers was an exceedingly forceful man of thirty-five , well-dressed , well-formed , with a hard , smooth , evenly chiseled face , which was ornamented by a short , black mustache and fine , black , clearly penciled eyebrows .',

 'All had their peculiar squint of eye or position or motion which meant `` Done !',

 'It was in this light , unquestionably , that Cowperwood saw her , for from the beginning he could not keep his eyes off her .',


 'A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long , peculiarly shaded hair .',

 'His face , because of its full , clear , big , inscrutable eyes , had an expression which was almost babyish .',

 'He arose and came over to her , looking into her eyes .',

 'Mrs. Cowperwood was shocked by the nudity of the Venus which conveyed an atmosphere of European freedom not common to America ; but she said nothing .',


 'Little Frank , and later Lillian , blue-eyed and golden-haired , touched his imagination for a while .',




 'They were pretty girls , healthy , smiling , Celtic , their heads close together , their eyes looking straight out at you .',

 '`` He allowed a semi-twinkle to rest in his eye as he looked his visitor over .',

 'As he did so a young girl bounded in from the street , red-cheeked , blue-eyed , wearing a scarlet cape with the peaked hood thrown over her red-gold hair .',


 "He saw in his mind 's eye a handsome building , fitted with an immense plate-glass window ; inside his hardwood fixtures visible ; and over the door , or to one side of it , set in bronze letters , Cowperwood & Co. Vaguely but surely he began to see looming before him , like a fleecy tinted cloud on the horizon , his future fortune .',


 'The altar , during high mass , lit with a half-hundred or more candles , and dignified and made impressive by the rich , lacy vestments of the priests and the acolytes , the impressive needlework and gorgeous colorings of the amice , chasuble , cope , stole , and maniple , took her fancy and held her eye .',

 'In spite of her vanity and egotism , she felt a little overawed before him at times -- keyed up .',


 'His eye was of vague gray-blue ; his hair a dusty light-brown and thin .',

 'Here he came under the eyes of Edward Malia Butler , and was slightly useful to him .',

 'Edward Strobik , the chief of them , and the one most useful to Mollenhauer , in a minor way , was a very spry person of about thirty-five at this time -- lean and somewhat forceful , with black hair , black eyes , and an inordinately large black mustache .',

 'He was big and rather doleful to look upon , with sandy brown hair and brown eyes , but fairly intelligent , and absolutely willing to approve anything which was not too broad in its crookedness and which would afford him sufficient protection to keep him out of the clutches of the law .',

 'Thomas Wycroft , the last of this useful but minor triumvirate , was a tall , lean man , candle-waxy , hollow-eyed , gaunt of face , pathetic to look at physically , but shrewd .',

 'Large sheets of clear , beveled glass were used , some oval , some oblong , some square , and some circular , following a given theory of eye movement .',

 "He discussed woods with him -- rosewood , mahogany , walnut , English oak , bird's-eye maple , and the manufactured effects such as ormolu , marquetry , and Boule , or buhl .',

 "He told of the difficulties and disadvantages of certain finishes , but finally recommended ormolu furniture for the reception room , medallion tapestry for the parlor , French renaissance for the dining-room and library , and bird's-eye maple ( dyed blue in one instance , and left its natural color in another ) and a rather lightly constructed and daintily carved walnut for the other rooms .',

 'She was a stout , broad-faced woman , smiling-mouthed most of the time , with blurry , gray Irish eyes , and a touch of red in her hair , now modified by grayness .',

 '`` Mrs. Cowperwood , who was before her secretaire in her new boudoir , lifted her eyebrows .',

 "`` Well , Aileen '' -- she could see his genial eyes -- '' how is it with you ?',



 'She looked exceedingly winsome -- eager and bright-eyed .',

 'Her complexion , naturally high in tone because of the pink of health , was enhanced by the tiniest speck of black court-plaster laid upon her cheekbone ; and her hair , heightened in its reddish-gold by her dress , was fluffed loosely and adroitly about her eyes .',

 'The main mass of this treasure was done in two loose braids caught up in a black spangled net at the back of her neck ; and her eyebrows had been emphasized by a pencil into something almost as significant as her hair .',

 "Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur , like a spirited collie 's , and her even teeth showed beautifully .',

 'This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes .',

 'She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy .',



 '`` He shot a level , interpretive glance into her eyes , then left .',

 'She passed close to him a number of times , her eyes wide and smiling , her lips parted , her teeth agleam , and he felt a stirring of sympathy and companionship for her which he had not previously experienced .',

 '`` He was a little keyed up because of her -- slightly cloudy in his thoughts -- because she was generating a problem in his life , or would if he let her , and so his talk was a little tame .',

 'He had not intended to give this particular remark a serious turn ; but , now that she was so near him , he looked into her eyes steadily but with a soft appeal and said , `` Yes , why ?',

 'Her right hand was on his shoulder , and she was close to him , looking into his eyes .',

 'She lifted shy eyes to him now , for , in spite of her gay , aggressive force , she was afraid of him .',

 'She looked up quickly , directly , but his strong eyes were too much for her .',



 *'It was as though there were another pair of eyes behind those they saw , watching through thin , obscuring curtains .',*
 
 'Slipping his arms about her waist , he looked at her flushed cheeks , her clear , moist eyes and red mouth .',

 'She put her lips to his and dreamed into his eyes .',

 'He should be strong , handsome , direct , successful , with clear eyes , a ruddy glow of health , and a certain native understanding and sympathy -- a love of life which matched her own .',

 '`` Now look in my eyes .',

 'Her eyes , half closed , saw this happy world ; and , listening to him , she was fascinated .',

 'An old , nervous shifting of the eyes had almost ceased , and a feeling of restfulness , which had previously been restlessness , and had sprung from a sense of necessity , had taken its place .',

 'His large feet were incased in good , square-toed , soft-leather shoes ; his stocky chest and fat legs were made somewhat agreeable to the eye by a well-cut suit of brownish-gray cloth ; and his neck was now surrounded by a low , wing-point white collar and brown-silk tie .',

 '`` exclaimed Stener , his round eyes fixed on Cowperwood in a rather helpless , appealing way .',

 'Gray was an enthusiast and almost instantly he conveyed some of his suppressed and yet fiery love of the beautiful to Cowperwood .',

 'Aileen looked at him with clear , questioning , uncertain eyes .',

 "`` That looks rather serious , '' he said , calmly , to his companions , a cold , commanding force coming into his eyes and voice .',

 'They would not view all that with a kindly eye .',




 '`` she sympathized , looking into his solemn eyes .',

 '`` He walked to the door , and she followed him with eager , sympathetic eyes .',





 'He was a still man , as such a man might well have been -- feeble and fish-like in his handshake , wan and slightly lackadaisical in his smile , but speaking always with eyes that answered for every defect .',

 "`` He looked directly into his long-time friend 's eyes , and they smiled .',

 "`` I could n't get them to call a conference with any of the big moneyed men as yet , '' he added , warily .',

 'His gray eyebrows and gray hair looked rather shaggy and disheveled , and his side-whiskers anything but decorative .',

 "The old gentleman 's eyes were tired , and his face was gray .',

 "As he stood in the door looking to catch the eye of Rivers , the 'change gong sounded , and trading stopped .',

 "`` He raised his eyes to the announcer 's balcony .',

 '`` He was in front of Stener now , looking him directly in the eye and by the kinetic force of his mental way attempting to make Stener take the one step that might save him -- Cowperwood -- however little in the long run it might do for Stener .',

 'His face was a grayish-blue : his eyelids and eye rings puffy and his hands and lips moist .',


 "The result was eventually this letter which now spread clear and grim before Butler 's eyes .',

 "On first reading these lines the intelligence they conveyed sent a peculiar chill over Butler's sturdy frame .',

 'His jaw instinctively closed , and his gray eyes narrowed .',

 'They see their children every day , and through the eyes of affection ; and despite their natural charm and their own strong parental love , the children are apt to become not only commonplaces , but ineffably secure against evil .',

 '`` Aileen took it , and for a second was relieved to be able to lower her eyes to the paper .',

 "`` she said , lifting her eyes to her father 's .',

 "He used to tell her that she had `` eyes like buttons , '' `` feet like a pussy-cat , '' and hands that were `` just five cents' worth , '' they were so little .',

 "`` '' Well , now , dry your eyes .',



 "`` '' Listen to me , '' began Cowperwood , eyeing him fixedly .',

 'There was a look of girlish distress in her eyes , which , however , she was trying hard to conceal .',

 '`` he inquired , putting his arm around her and looking quietly into her nervous eyes .',

 '`` She put her hands tightly together on his bosom , and he looked consolingly into her eyes .',

 'Her eyelids , were trembling , and her lips .',

 "`` Tears were in Stires 's eyes .',

 'There were tears of suffering in his eyes .',

 '`` said his father , lifting his sad eyes in a peculiar way .',

 'She felt it a sort of duty to stay in bed and try to sleep ; but her eyes were quite wide , and her brain hurt her .',

 'His eyes were blue , his hair brown , with a suggestion of sandy red in it .',

 'The Senator had long since graduated from State to national politics , and was an interesting figure in the United States Senate at Washington , where his voice in all the conservative and moneyed councils of the nation was of great weight .',

 "`` There was a slight gleam of triumph in his eye as he said this , at the same time that there was a slight shadow of disappointment in Mollenhauer 's .',

 '`` Both Mollenhauer and Simpson turned a reserved and inquiring eye on their usually genial associate .',

 'The moment Mollenhauer laid eyes on Cowperwood he realized , however , that he had a powerful personality to deal with .',


 "`` '' Quite so , '' replied Mollenhauer , looking Cowperwood in the eye steadily and estimating the force and accuracy of the man at their real value .',

 '`` It was a time when all the little rats and mice were scurrying to cover because of the presence of a great , fiery-eyed public cat somewhere in the dark , and only the older and wiser rats were able to act .',

 'Shannon was a smart , athletic , good-looking fellow , all of five feet ten inches in height , sandy-haired , pink-cheeked , blue-eyed , considerable of an orator and a fine legal fighter .',

 "`` This is a great dumb show , Mr. Mayor , '' he observed once to Borchardt , quietly , and the latter replied , with a smile and a kindly eye , that as far as he was concerned , it was a form of procedure which was absolutely unavoidable at this time .',

 'His hair had grown very gray in but a few weeks , his step slow , his face pallid , his eyes sunken .',

 "He made the simple excuse one day of business , which was common enough in his case , and journeyed to New York -- nearly five hours away as the trains ran then -- arriving at two o'clock .',

 'At the offices on lower Broadway , he asked to see the manager , whom he found to be a large , gross-featured , heavy-bodied man of fifty , gray-eyed , gray-haired , puffily outlined as to countenance , but keen and shrewd , and with short , fat-fingered hands , which drummed idly on his desk as he talked .',

 "`` Sit down , '' he said , studying the old Irishman from under thick , bushy eyebrows .',


 "Chapter XXXVI The very next day there called at Butler 's office a long , preternaturally solemn man of noticeable height and angularity , dark-haired , dark-eyed , sallow , with a face that was long and leathery , and particularly hawk-like , who talked with Butler for over an hour and then departed .',

 'She had such lovely smooth arms , a full , luxuriously tapering throat and neck ; her golden-red hair floated like an aureole about her head , and her large eyes sparkled .',

 'She had light-blue eyes and a genial smile .',



 '`` He had come over and taken her pretty chin in his hands , and was looking solemnly into her eyes .',

 "Confronted by her father , Aileen was now attempting to stare defiantly , to look reproachful , but Butler 's deep gray eyes beneath their shaggy brows revealed such a weight of weariness and despair as even she , in her anger and defiance , could not openly flaunt .',

 "She loved Cowperwood ; she was permanently disgraced in her father 's eyes .',

 '`` Butler looked at her with strange , non-understanding eyes .',

 '`` He paused , looking sadly but firmly at Aileen under his shaggy eyebrows .',

 'His eyes almost filled .',

 'Her eyes clouded , for she was terribly hurt .',

 "`` Honey , '' he said , quickly , when he saw her eyes , `` you do n't understand .',

 'Cowperwood shook his head , following her with his eyes .',

 'The actual beginning of the trial found almost all of the inhabitants of this city of six hundred thousand `` keyed up .',

 'A third bailiff guarded the door of the jury-room ; and in addition to these there were present a court clerk -- small , pale , candle-waxy , with colorless milk-and-water eyes , and thin , pork-fat-colored hair and beard , who looked for all the world like an Americanized and decidedly decrepit Chinese mandarin -- and a court stenographer .',


 'Cowperwood surveyed Stener , who was one of the witnesses , and who now , in his helpless fright over his own fate , was without malice toward any one .',

 "When his eye caught Cowperwood 's steady beam , it faltered and drooped .',

 '`` Cowperwood also watched Mrs. Stener out of the tail of his eye -- an undersized , peaked , and sallow little woman , whose clothes fitted her abominably .',

 'It was anything you might choose to make of it -- a door to illegal opportunity ; a cloud of dust to be cast in the eyes of those who might choose , and rightfully , to see ; a veil to be dropped arbitrarily between truth and its execution , justice and its judgment , crime and punishment .',


 'One man in particular , however , an old man of sixty-five , with iron-gray hair and beard , shaggy eyebrows , sallow complexion , and stooped shoulders , struck him as having that kindness of temperament and breadth of experience which might under certain circumstances be argumentatively swayed in his favor .',

 'There was a stout wholesale grocer , with red cheeks , blue eyes , and flaxen hair , who Cowperwood said he thought was stubborn .',

 'Judge Payderson , eyeing him severely , let him go .',

 'His eyes , as he took his seat in the witness-chair , laying his hand on the Bible and swearing to tell the truth , roved in a restless , nervous manner .',

 'There was the faintest touch of cynical humor in his hard blue eyes at times ; but mostly he was friendly , alert , placid-looking , without seeming in the least sentimental or even kindly .',

 "At the time my client asked for the check and took it away with him and deposited it in his own bank to his own account , he failed , so the prosecution insists , to put the sixty thousand dollars ' worth of certificates for which he had received the check , in the sinking-fund ; and having failed to do that , and being compelled by the pressure of financial events the same day to suspend payment generally , he thereby , according to the prosecution and the anxious leaders of the Republican party in the city , became an embezzler , a thief , a this or that -- anything you please so long as you find a substitute for George W. Stener and the indifferent leaders of the Republican party in the eyes of the people .',

 "Therefore he laid his hands firmly on the rail at first , looked the jurors steadily in the eyes for a time , and , having framed a few thoughts in his mind began : '' Now , gentlemen of the jury , it seems to me that if we all pay strict attention to what has transpired here to-day , we will have no difficulty in reaching a conclusion ; and it will be a very satisfactory one , if we all try to interpret the facts correctly .',

 'It would seem as though the physical substance of life -- this apparition of form which the eye detects and calls real were shot through with some vast subtlety that loves order , that is order .',

 'The jail in question , which was known locally as Moyamensing Prison , was located at Tenth and Reed Streets , and from an architectural and artistic point of view was not actually displeasing to the eye .',

 'Zanders was a little man , dark , with a short , stubby mustache , and a shrewd though not highly intelligent eye .',

 "There was no particular danger of escape , for a guard stood always at his private door instructed `` to keep an eye '' on the general movements of all the inmates .',

 '`` Cowperwood , eyeing the fat sheriff from his position , understood what it was all about .',

 "John , '' he called to a sleepy factotum , who appeared from another room , rubbing his eyes , `` is the key to Number Six down here ?',

 'Her eyes , complexion and hair were fresh and healthy .',

 "`` It 's gettin ' colder , I 'm thinkin ' , '' said Butler , by way of conversation , and eyeing Aileen 's empty chair .',


 'And even if he , Cowperwood , was a convicted embezzler in the eyes of the public , that did not make him so .',

 '`` He paused and looked calmly at the old contractor , who eyed him grimly in return .',

 '`` Butler looked at Cowperwood with shrewd , calculating eyes .',

 "He was whipped , literally beaten , at his own game , and Cowperwood could see it in the old man 's eyes .',

 'He conveyed much of his own optimism to all those who knew him and were interested in his welfare , but of course there were many who were not .',

 'He wanted to stay in Philadelphia and fight the thing to a finish -- putting himself where he had been before the fire ; rehabilitating himself in the eyes of the public .',

 '`` He set his teeth and his gray eyes fairly snapped their determination .',

 "He entered the sitting-room , and there sat his wife by the oblong center-table , sewing a hook and eye on one of Lillian , second 's , petticoats .',

 'Her eyes were a little hollow , and reddish about the rims , but otherwise she showed no sign of her keen mental distress .',

 'She turned back to the table , her left hand to her mouth , her eyes in a queer , hazy , melancholy mist .',

 'Suddenly quite outside of her own volition , with no thought that she was going to do such a thing , her bosom began to heave , her throat contracted in four or five short , sharp , aching spasms , her eyes burned , and she shook in a vigorous , anguished , desperate , almost one might have said dry-eyed , cry , so hot and few were the tears .',

 'Cowperwood wanted Relihan to approach the newspapers and see if he could not readjust their attitude so as to work to get him out , and he wanted Walter Leigh to head the movement of getting up a signed petition which should contain all the important names of moneyed people and others , asking the Governor to release him .',

 'Her eyes these days !',

 'And Cowperwood , looking in her eyes and realizing this reasonless , if so comforting fever for him , smiled and was touched .',


 'Payderson eyed him as he had the others .',

 "Once , when a boy , in one of his perambulations through several of the surrounding towns , he had passed a village `` lock-up , '' as the town prisons were then called -- a small , square , gray building with long iron-barred windows , and he had seen , at one of these rather depressing apertures on the second floor , a none too prepossessing drunkard or town ne'er-do-well who looked down on him with bleary eyes , unkempt hair , and a sodden , waxy , pallid face , and called -- for it was summer and the jail window was open : '' Hey , sonny , get me a plug of tobacco , will you ?',

 "The latter , the receiving overseer of the prison -- a thin , practical , executive-looking person with narrow gray eyes and light hair , took the paper which the sheriff 's deputy handed him and read it .',

 "`` You will have to take off your clothes and take a bath , '' said Kendall to Cowperwood , eyeing him curiously .',

 'He was hollow-chested , squint-eyed , and rather shambling , but spry enough withal .',



 "Kendall surveyed Cowperwood 's decidedly graceful figure , already inclining to a slight thickening around the waist , and approved of it as superior to that of most who came here .',

 "He called out the color of his eyes , his hair , his mustache , and , looking into his mouth , exclaimed , '' Teeth , all sound .',

 "Cowperwood 's clear-seeing eyes took it all in at a glance .',




 'He eyed Cowperwood and Cowperwood eyed him .',

 '`` He talked slowly and emphatically , looking Desmas directly in the eye all of the time .',

 "Some of the cells have a yard there ; if there are any empty -- '' The warden cocked his eye wisely , and Cowperwood saw that his tot was not to be as bad as he had anticipated -- though bad enough .',

 "To Mollenhauer went the furniture and decorations of the entry-hall and reception-room of Henry Cowperwood 's house , and to Edward Strobik two of Cowperwood 's bird's-eye maple bedroom suites for the most modest of prices .',

 "Of course , it 's against the rules to have your wife or sister or anybody like that , except on visiting days -- '' And here he paused and rolled a large and informing eye on Cowperwood -- such an eye as was supposed to convey dark and mysterious things .',

 'She kissed his eyes , his hair , his cheeks .',


 'Her thought , when he first broached this , was that she ought to make some demonstration of astonishment or wrath : but when she looked into his steady , examining eyes , so free from the illusion of or interest in demonstrations of any kind , she realized how useless it would be .',

 '`` Cowperwood looked at his wife with unflinching eyes .',



 '`` Suddenly tears came to her eyes , and she flounced scornfully and yet sorrowfully out .',

 'A hard , contentious look came into his eyes .',

 '`` asked Callum , grimly , looking Hibbs in the eye .',

 'His hair was straw-colored , his eyes blue , and his cheeks pink .

 '`` Cowperwood surveyed his friends with a level gaze .',

 "Jay Cooke & Co. A magnificent gleam of triumph sprang into Cowperwood 's eye .',

 'His feet are in the trap of circumstance ; his eyes are on an illusion .',

 'In electrical mechanics we pride ourselves on our ability to make over one brilliant scene into another in the twinkling of an eye , and flash before the gaze of an onlooker picture after picture , which appear and disappear as we look .']
