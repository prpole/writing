 #Legible Eyes
 
 Those large, **clear gray eyes were full of intelligence**.
 
 His **eyes had a peculiar, subtle ray in them**—not a gleam.
 
You could have looked at his lean, pedantic body, his frizzled gray hair, **his fishy, blue-gray eyes, without any depth of speculation in them,** and his nicely modeled but unimportant face, and told him that he was without imagination; but he would not have believed you—would have fined you for contempt of court.

He now considered his superior with **nervous dog-like eyes,** and looked at Cowperwood with a certain cunning appreciation of his lot and a show of initial mistrust.

He had a vigorous growth of short-clipped, iron-gray hair, and a bristly iron-gray mustache, very short, keen, **intelligent blue-gray eyes;** a florid complexion; and even-edged, savage-looking teeth, which showed the least bit in a slightly wolfish way when he smiled.

Instead of the weak, anaemic body and the shifty eyes of the average prisoner, he saw a man whose face and form blazed energy and power, and whose vigorous erectness no wretched clothes or conditions could demean.

He lifted his head when Desmas appeared, glad that any form should have appeared at his door, and looked at him with large, clear, examining eyes—those eyes that in the past had inspired so much confidence and surety in all those who had known him.

#Inscrutability in the Eyes
 
You could tell nothing by his eyes.

He would dandle Frank, Jr., who was the first to arrive, on his knee, looking at his chubby feet, his kindling eyes, his almost formless yet bud-like mouth, and wonder at the process by which children came into the world.
 
It was placid, like fine, white wax, and quite as cold; and those deep, vague, inscrutable eyes !

His naturally even-molded face was set in fine, classic lines; his eyes were as hard as chilled steel.

His inscrutable eyes took them all in and gave no sign.

The frontal bone descended in a protruding curve over the nose, and projected solemnly over the eyes, which burned with a shrewd, inquiring gaze.

Nor were his eyes as frank as those of Butler, nor as defiant as those of Mollenhauer; but for subtlety they were unmatched by either—deep, strange, receding, cavernous eyes which contemplated you as might those of a cat looking out of a dark hole, and suggesting all the artfulness that has ever distinguished the feline family.

his slightly Slavic, highly intelligent countenance burning with a pair of keen, piercing, inscrutable black eyes.

…said Cowperwood, looking at him with steady, curious, unrevealing eyes, and merely interpolating this to obtain a moment for reflection.

He could not help thinking how uncanny the man 's squint eyes looked under its straight outstanding visor.
