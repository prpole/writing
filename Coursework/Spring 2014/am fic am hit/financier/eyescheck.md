 He lay at the bottom of the clear glass tank on the yellow sand , apparently seeing nothing -- you could not tell in which way his beady , black buttons of eyes were looking -- but apparently they were never off the body of the squid .
 
 He told his wife about it , and so his son , in this roundabout way , heard it , and his clear , big eyes glistened .
 
 Those large , clear gray eyes were full of intelligence .
 
 Black hair and snapping black eyes were her portion , with pretty pigtails down her back , and dainty feet and ankles to match a dainty figure .
 
 He was , to look at , a phlegmatic type of man -- short , stout , wrinkled about the eyes , rather protuberant as to stomach , red-necked , red-faced , the least bit popeyed , but shrewd , kindly , good-natured , and witty .
 
 Already his eyes had the look that subtle years of thought bring .
 
 You could tell nothing by his eyes .
 
The latter , a big man with curly gray hair , a gnarled and yet pudgy face , and little eyes that peeked out shrewdly through fat eyelids , looked at Cowperwood curiously when he came in .

 His eyes had a peculiar , subtle ray in them -- not a gleam .
 
He would dandle Frank , Jr. , who was the first to arrive , on his knee , looking at his chubby feet , his kindling eyes , his almost formless yet bud-like mouth , and wonder at the process by which children came into the world .

He saw one workingman swinging his pail , and evidently not contemplating any such denouement to his day's work , pause , listen as the squad approached , hesitate as it drew close , and as it passed , with a peculiar look of uncertainty or wonder in his eyes , fall in behind and march solemnly away to the enlisting quarters .

No longer a “rough neck,” but a solid , reddish-faced man , slightly tanned , with broad shoulders and a solid chest , gray eyes , gray hair , a typically Irish face made wise and calm and undecipherable by much experience .

She was small and dark , with a turned-up nose , snapping black eyes , a pert , inquisitive , intelligent , and alas , somewhat critical , air .

When he touched her hand at parting , it was as though she had received an electric shock , and she recalled that it was very difficult for her to look directly into his eyes .

His naturally even-molded face was set in fine , classic lines ; his eyes were as hard as chilled steel .

It was placid , like fine , white wax , and quite as cold ; and those deep , vague , inscrutable eyes !

The frontal bone descended in a protruding curve over the nose , and projected solemnly over the eyes , which burned with a shrewd , inquiring gaze .

His shrewd gray Irish eyes looked into Mollenhauer 's , who returned his gaze .

Nor were his eyes as frank as those of Butler , nor as defiant as those of Mollenhauer ; but for subtlety they were unmatched by either -- deep , strange , receding , cavernous eyes which contemplated you as might those of a cat looking out of a dark hole , and suggesting all the artfulness that has ever distinguished the feline family .

Three-quarters of an hour later , Sengstack called on him for the second time that day -- Abner Sengstack , small , dark-faced , club-footed , a great sole of leather three inches thick under his short , withered right leg , his slightly Slavic , highly intelligent countenance burning with a pair of keen , piercing , inscrutable black eyes .

But it was so hard to confront him -- to look into his eyes .

You could have looked at his lean , pedantic body , his frizzled gray hair , his fishy , blue-gray eyes , without any depth of speculation in them , and his nicely modeled but unimportant face , and told him that he was without imagination ; but he would not have believed you -- would have fined you for contempt of court .

His inscrutable eyes took them all in and gave no sign .

…said Cowperwood , looking at him with steady , curious , unrevealing eyes , and merely interpolating this to obtain a moment for reflection .

He could not help thinking how uncanny the man 's squint eyes looked under its straight outstanding visor .

He now considered his superior with nervous dog-like eyes , and looked at Cowperwood with a certain cunning appreciation of his lot and a show of initial mistrust .

He had a vigorous growth of short-clipped , iron-gray hair , and a bristly iron-gray mustache , very short , keen , intelligent blue-gray eyes ; a florid complexion ; and even-edged , savage-looking teeth , which showed the least bit in a slightly wolfish way when he smiled .

Instead of the weak , anaemic body and the shifty eyes of the average prisoner , he saw a man whose face and form blazed energy and power , and whose vigorous erectness no wretched clothes or conditions could demean .

He lifted his head when Desmas appeared , glad that any form should have appeared at his door , and looked at him with large , clear , examining eyes -- those eyes that in the past had inspired so much confidence and surety in all those who had known him .
