#Why Beloved?#
-Given that Morrison’s ten novels are all more or less historical
-and also, why is Morrison so universally recognized as a singular figure
-one of the first major american novelists to hold a higher degree in literary studies (not even really possible prior to the mid-20th century
-hm... written to stand up to canon and classroom reading?
-lines like “What God have in mind, I wonder” invite analysis of, for example, the tree on her back as symbol
-Does a(n ethnic) group’s history need to be initiated by a member of that group? (The important basis for the critique of Styron.)
-"I write in order to enlighten black people, not from a need to explain to others.”
-"womanism”: the african-american woman as a particular subject


#Internal References to Other Works#
-making a case for reference to Uncle Tom’s Cabin on a structural level---white slaveowners break promise not to sell slaves which leads to escape
-similar argument made for Huckleberry Finn (female interracial relationship rather than male in Sethe and Denver)
-Morrison in a way continuing the work of Faulkner
-scholarly well picked-over
-stylistic: terse prose with flowery, extended dialogues
-"taste for the gothic”
-privileging endurance and “battered strength”
-Faulkner’s idea that nothing ever dies, at least in considering the relation of the past to the present, becomes a starting point for Beloved
-In many ways consciously finding holes in the canon that need to be filled
-both a professor and an employee of Random House

#Accounting for the Facts of Slavery#
-interest in failures of narratives relating to slavery
-the failure of documentary evidence as well as oral and experiential evidence
-note that Sethe literally makes the ink for the school teacher
-Morrison describes her novel as a kind of stand-in for a physical memorial
-attempt also to tell the story of those who did NOT survive as well as those who did

#Austin’s Argument#
-take seriously novel-as-memorial
-starting point as a traumatic history: not exclusively, but “80 percent”
-history that threatens the present; past exists in the present, and if remembered wrong can threaten us now
-nevertheless it is imperative that we remember to avoid, in some sense, complicity

#Versus Styron, Elkins; Morrison and Holocaust#
-recall that he picks up on Elkins’s analogy of slavery with the holocaust
-between Styron/Elkins and Morrison much holocaust writing as arisen; one of the major questions is, how do we memorialize something like this? Is even language sufficient to discussing this? As a corollary, what would happen if we forgot it?
-Morrison’s epigraph: “Sixty Million and more”: implicit comparison of slavery to the holocaust; a swipe?; competitive re suffering?; accepted holocaust toll at the time was six million, she brings out the sixty
-slavery as identical to the first 200 years of Hitler’s would-be thousand-year reich
-Morrison DOES seem interested in aspects of the Elkins thesis, particularly the detachment that comes from being subjected to slavery
-worth tracing detachment as a psychological state binding the community

#Rememory#
-search: “Some things go. Pass on. Some things just stay....”

#The Family Unit in the ‘60s#
-"The Moynihan Report” - “The Negro Family: A Case for National Action” (1965)
-draws on Elkins
-"ghetto culture”; “matriarchal” households; a “tangle of pathology”
-slavery dismantled black family structure which contributes, allegedly, to a problem in the black community of the ‘60s
-William Ryan: “pleading guilty to the savagery and oppression against the Negro that happened 100 years ago, in order to escape trial for the crimes of today”
-Ellison: sociologists continued pathologization of the black community demeans it; any culture that could rise from its brutalization to initiate its own freedom is obviously more than the “sum of its brutalization”
