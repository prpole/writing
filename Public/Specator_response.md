On Wednesday, April 1, the Spectator posted [an article](http://columbiaspectator.com/sports/2015/04/01/dont-jump-support-new-yorks-new-football-club-just-yet) warning away would-be NYCFC supporters. Its reason for doing so was that without a robust youth academy system, MLS in general and NYCFC in particular will remain a repository for aging stars like David Villa and Frank Lampard seeing out their careers in a less demanding competition. This is a concern frequently cited in tandem with derisive epithets like "geriatric league" and other (still somewhat justified) complaints about the quality of play in the league. The article's claim---that a truly robust league would rely more on domestic youth development than pricey international signings---is an excellent one; you can look at Premier League clubs like Southampton in addition to those mentioned in the article for examples of clubs whose league standing and financial security have both been massively strengthened by such an academy. 

Unfortunately, the article neglects to mention *[that NYCFC inaugurated a robust youth development program](http://www.nycfc.com/academy) before they had kicked a single competitive ball*, and indeed [so has every other team in the league](http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/http%3A//pressbox.mlssoccer.com/homegrownplayers). 

NYCFC's Youth Development League, [announced in early February](http://www.nycfc.com/post/2015/02/09/new-york-city-fc-announce-ground-breaking-youth-development-league-1), is the first phase in the development of their academy. As first steps go for something like this, theirs is very intelligent. Instead of starting from scratch, they began with eleven existing youth clubs around the city, bringing them together into a competitive league that will lead into the next stage of the academy's development and be supported by the resources of City Football Group. A solid development league comes with a competitive advantage of its own, in that, [according to the league's 2014 roster rules](http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations), it allows a club to sign talented players out of its own league without risking losing them in the draft. 

In initiating their own youth development program, then, NYCFC joins an already standard, already vivacious program that encompasses clubs from both of the league's nations. They do so in the same year that LA Galaxy's Gyasi Zardes, who last year [broke the homegrown player single-season goal record](http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/09/08/hes-arrived-gyasi-zardes-breaks-diego-fagundezs-single-season-goalscoring-re) set in 2013 by Diego Fegundez, gets his first call-up for the U.S. Men's National Team. 

The benefits of the program must go beyond the pitch, however: the best thing that could result from this program is not a homegrown star for NYCFC, but investment that benefits the city. Ticket revenues should be driven into programs that supports grassroots youth programs across the five boroughs, not massive salaries for international players. Better yet, City Football Group should foot this bill, improving the city as their price of entry.

What has been suggested as a reason not to support NYCFC is actually precisely the opposite. And although it's true that dumping money into the pockets of late-career international players is not a sustainable development strategy for the league, the advantages of homegrown players training alongside the likes of David Villa and Frank Lampard should not be underestimated. Nor should such players' participation in the youth leagues be seen as anything but an advantage for youth-league players, as long as the salaries of such players don't dip into the coffers of youth development.

This argument regarding homegrown players in the States comes at a time when similar issues are being raised in papers around the world. A recent proposal from the British Football Association's chairman Greg Dyke would force Premier League squads to contain a minimum of twelve players, up from eight, and [many club managers are rushing to back him](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/01/former-england-managers-back-greg-dyke-fa-homegrown). Like the decision to incentivize the signing of homegrown MLS players, this proposal is meant to strengthen football across the nation in question, but it is far from resolved whether it would raise the quality or good fortune of British players. (A particularly well-sustained treatment of the question can be found in Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski's *Soccernomics*, published last year.) MLS will have to work through these problems on their own, but the point is that these problems are far from new.

There are plenty of reasons for a New York soccer fan not to support NYCFC. Maybe you already support the Red Bulls or another MLS club. Many fans of Premier League clubs other than Manchester City are uncomfortable with the similarity in branding between the two clubs, both of which are owned by City Football Group. The one that keeps me up at night is the amount of Sheik Mansour's fortune that comes from fossil fuels, but I'm comforted by the fact that his investments in the teams have not yet been profitable. (It is also far from clear that supporting a team potentially funded by oil money constitutes a contribution to the oil economy; believe me, I've thought about this plenty.) Whatever the reasons for not supporting NYCFC are, the club's youth development policy should not be among them.
