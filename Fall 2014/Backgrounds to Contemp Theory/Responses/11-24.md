Today, the struggle for human rights---at least in the richest parts of North America and Europe, and less exclusively elsewhere---seems to be centered on the intersection of two of Levinas's postulates: that "the rights of man" increasingly entail "all the legal rules that are the necessary conditions for the actual exercise of those rights" and defense against "the risk of [those rights] being belied or infringed upon by the rights of the other man" (121-2). A complicated discourse, mediated as always by wealth inequality and uneven political representation, has been built up around the question of whose rights are to be extended by the law rather than how to protect each equally. On one hand, this is more or less an agreement with Levinas's eventual arrival at the necessity of a "vigilance totally different from political intelligence" (123). But it is also a recognition that the articulation of a legal subject benefits citizens in proportion to their proximity to the legal subject that has been articulated. I mean something pretty close to Rancière's idea of the *demos* as the unrepresented and, in the structure of a given country's legal system, unrepresentable---except I wonder if the binary of those represented and those "who have no qualification for exercising power" is too polarized in Rancière's telling. It seems that it could exclude possible situations in which one person is *more* the "subject of the rights of man" than another, for example in the case of a legal suit or a political struggle. Put another way, perhaps within the system of consensus in which there is a forced "identity of law and fact" there is less complete a totalizing binary than Rancière's system allows, precisely because of the maintenance of laws that in theory protect the rights of all but in practice extend the rights of the few.
