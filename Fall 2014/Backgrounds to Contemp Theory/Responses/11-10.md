In Sartre's explanation of the "Jew," he presents an account that seems in some ways sympathetic with and in some ways fundamentally opposed to Nietzsche's version of the invention of good and evil. We can perhaps read Sartre in the same sense in which we read Nietzsche, as theorizing difference. Sartre's relationship to inheritance and agency seems somewhat more complex, and also (unsurprisingly given the relative publication dates) more comfortable to 21st-century reader. Where Nietzsche gives a deterministic account of groups of people in terms of species, to Sartre race is one in a vast and "over-determin[ing]" set of circumstances that make, in sum, the "situation" within which a person acts (79). Sartre does not need to use speciation to to understand difference, and as such he does not come to understand it as predatory hierarchy. Neither is it necessary for him to make difference wholly contingent on circumstance. The Sartrian "situation" is one in which each of these categories come together and appear to be mediated by an individual agency, the type of "personality" on which his conception of the anti-Semite relies. The emergence of identifying concepts, however, especially morally polarized concepts, is where the differences between these two systems becomes most diametric. Nietzsche's prey/bird-of-prey understanding of identity and domination posits certain characteristics as fixed (and with them outcomes of struggle) and every identifying category or position on a moral spectrum develops out of this determined, and basically *materially* determined, substratum. If we accept Sartre's statement that "If the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him," no such reflexivity of representational category to the specifics of domination can hold up. Sartre replaces Nietzsche's semi-racialized hierarchy of domination with the invention of a category out of a more diffuse set of determinants and the retroactive (and largely subconscious) application of that category to a group that is afterwards subjected to a struggle for dominance. In this sense, Sartre's model seems almost to model a more economic determinism, in which the disenchantment from a faceless system is given a face for the sole purpose of turning economic conditions into simple enmity. Put more direclty, Nietzsche's "Evil" arises from the struggle, while Sartre's struggle arises from the invention of an evil. 

This leads to a danger for which I think Sartre is too much of an apologist, namely, the danger of socialist and working-class anti-Semitism. His claims that workers are not anti-Semites and that any appearances of class-derived anti-Semitism are illusory provide a convenient way of avoiding a difficult discontinuity in economic and social justice, in which ignorance is allowed to exist in the former that prevents the attainment of the latter. Claiming that a worker will never be an anti-Semite strikes me as the willful creation of a dangerous blindspot that has the potential to persist today.
