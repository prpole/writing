Invisibility

Obi as a thing, material object

	- law passed in 1760 after a rebellion on Jamaica, a rebellion that was organized by Obeah practitioners
	- outlaws supernatural practice largely in terms of the object-matter that goes into it; mentions feathers etc. by name; 
	- materials themselves; largely discarded items, things that have no economic role; gain power in terms of their uselessness
	- parts of things; parts that don't come together in a whole
	- also parts of bodies
	- inventorying objects in some ways misses the point 
	- obeah as a way of organizing people

Historical Jack

Proclamation

	- emphasis shifts from Three-Fingered Jack as leader of a gang to 3-fingered jack as the individual
	- denying reality of gange
	- also (this is me) kind of an example of using systemic enforcement of self-interest to wave off resistance through community; 

Mosely

	- medical context; 1799
	- makes Obi a science but also associates it with African roots; but in fact of course it is W. Indian
	- Obi presented as potentially useful for scientific knowledge, associated with Egypt also associated with the extra-legal
	- a lot of emphasis on his having seen the 

Burdett

	- Potentially more radical in that (I lost the thread here)

Back to Jack

	- What kind of Jack is Earle invested in, and why? Everyone is interested in the individual figure of Jack himself, pantomimes happening etc. Again the tension between individualism and rallying community
	- why the epistolary form?
	- Questioning the validity of paying for Jack; especially given that Jack does not come from Africa, no matter how it is represented
	- Earle constructing the mind of the colonist planter consciousness, something about the bounty of nature; super complicated to talk about captured people as part of the bounty of nature, something about withdraw from material realm/ cultivation is the same as capture? Hiedegger and 

Sidenote, hmm: is trash part of the commons
