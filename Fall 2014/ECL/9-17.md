#Isle of the Pines

Metadata

	- Roughly middle of the Indian ocean is where this is supposed to take place
	- Neville's dates something to -1694
	- First FICTION text of the semester -- think about what this allows Neville to do

Commerce

	- note that Pines is a bookkeeper; aka accountant on what is basically a trading mission
	- but nothing is produced, and the only thing he ends up COUNTING is his children; establishes children to some extent as economic goods
	- the labor of labor
	- Phillipa seen in purely utilitarian terms of fertility & yield

Insurrections

	- allows Neville to think of rebellion in the abstract, i.e. without having to do so w/r/t Barbados
	- don't forget the context of conflict of succession that is happening in England at the time, becomes a kind of way to think through it

Names

	- main tribe is the English
	- symbology of Pines; "Oak" would by more symbolic of royalty and maintenance of royal lines; Pines however are central in the making of ships, and especially in the making of masts: kind of a providence of travel and colonization

Climatist theory of race

	- identity shaped by climate; apparently this is active AS SOON AS THE 17TH AND 18TH C., not later in the 19th and 20th as I'd kind of thought 
	- so what happens when you transport an Englishperson to a new climate? The "creole" subject

New Religion

	- 

Misc.

	- note that Pines is essentially a working stiff prior to the Isle of Pines, at which point he becomes a patriarch, king, and Solomon


Readings for Monday are short (and on EEBO)

	- can skim the New England part of the second reading for Monday

Wednesday's readings are long (and I have to write a close-reading on it! Don't forget)
