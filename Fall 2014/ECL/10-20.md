Prickly pear

	- surrounding oneself with prickly pear to signal american iconography on one hand and guard the poem from criticism on the other
	- beetles that live on it often crushed to make red dye; including modern candies and red coats of yore
	- 

laboring slave
	
	- contrast with Grainger, who does not represent the laborer 
	- soldier imagery implies the everpresent threat of rebellion

sympathy

	- we have sympathy for the narrator who has sympathy for the slave, precursor to abolition sentiments

p. 10
	
	- prostrating oneself to another person or kissing feet; humility of for example christ; again prefigures abolitionist rhetoric 
	- think in terms of the hymnal meter, which is already placing us in a religious mode

Rushton Eclogues

	- 1746 - 1814
	- from Liverpool, which was the central port for slave ships
	- inspired by abolition movement and french revolution
	- eclogue form is an enjoyment of nature in the way the eclogue is not; indicating reference to if not refutation of grainger
	- much labor goes into the form itself
	- but then, where are the bucolic themes? where is the liesure/enjoyment? eclogue may be an ironic title

possible topic, how does sight work
- so look at ligon, oroonoko, maybe rushton if I ever read it
