Thomas Bell (1792-1880) was a dental surgeon and a zoologist, whose works of natural history such as *History of British Reptiles* (1839) and contribution to the *Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle* (1843) would eventually win him presidentship of the Linnean Society, in which position he would receive Darwin's and Wallace's papers on natural selection and the origin of species (to which he would prove a stern critic). As professor of zoology at King's College, London and a fellow fo the Linnaean Society, Bell was well known to Darwin and would eventually provide much-needed zoological expertise in the preparation of Darwin's *Voyage* notes and collections (Cleevely).

Linnaeaus note for page 2 (see ross's comment):

In particular the binomial nomenclature developed by Linnaeus and the taxonomic structures of his *Systema naturae*, but including taxonomy in a wider scope, as far back as Aristotle. Edmond Perrier's statement (1884) of Linnaeus that he "was convinced that all creatures are related in a logical fashion, much as our thoughts are linked to one another in an uninterrupted chain" could define the tension between observation and classification in this early work of Darwin: the young Darwin appears implicitly to suppose this affinity, only to repeatedly call it into question in moments when the chain is unclear (29).

For the note referring to Jean Baptiset Lamarck and Georges Cuvier: revise intial sentence of hegemonic theories by adding Saint-Hilaire and include the following note:

"The state of the theory transmutation of species prior to Darwin was defined by the conflict of Georges Cuvier with Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire and Jean Baptiste Lamarck: the debate came down to the question of a "unified plan," as supported by Saint-Hilaire and vilified by Cuvier, which organized the disparate parts of an organism and is necessary for any theory of gradual transmutation of species (Perrier 99-108); Darwin implicitly supports a "unified plan" in his analyses, but does not accept the Lamarckian schema of species inheritance. 

For Lamarck, environmental conditions determine generational transmutation of species; traits are acquired by the needs of an organism in a given environment. These traits are subsequently passed on to the following generation, which continues the gradual development of the trait. Darwin rejects this theory, and eventually comes to displace it with his own."

Add note on dissecting description passage, beginning "The observations that reinforce taxonomy":

'In this Darwin shows how embedded his identity as a natural historian truly is. Foucault makes a similar observation in discussing the qualities of perception that distinguish natural history from its predecessors: "By limiting and filtering the visible, structure enables it to be transcribed into language. It permits the visibility of animal or plant to pass over in its entirety into the discourse that receives it" (135). Darwin's descriptions to confirm Foucault's observations about the classifying representation, but they also show the extent to which the scientific gaze is a dissecting one. The "pass[ing] over...into the discourse that receives it" does not occur without a certain measure of dismemberment and re-formation. Later in Foucault's "Classifying" chapter: "description is to the object one looks at what the proposition is to the representation it expresses: its arrangement in a series, elements succeeding elements" (136). Darwin's move here and throughout his *Voyage* notes is to separate the elements to better understand the whole---but that understanding comes from the discourse that requires an elemental dissection.'

Add note to thesis paragraph after "rhetoric" in "syntax, rhetoric...":

"This paper does not engage extensively with Michel Foucault, but to proceed without some reference to his *The Order of Things* would be an oversight. My main point of Foucauldian contact is in pointing out Darwin's inherited body of contextual knowledge: the account that follows will detail the effects of a guiding perceptual consciousness inflected with a nascent natural history, a field in which (as Foucault puts it) "[t]he plant is...engraved in the material of the language into which it has been transposed, and recompenses its pure form before the reader's very eyes," and in which the "book becomes the herbarium of living structures" (135). I will argue in part that this mediated perceptual classification affects not only Darwin's consciousness and classification of other creatures, but also his self-consciousness and constitution of himself." 

Foucault notes:

129: Prior to natural history, " The history of a living being was that being itself, within the whole semantic network that connected it to the world. The division, so evident to us, between what we see, what others have observed and handed down, and what others imagine or na√Øvely believe, the great tripartition, apparently so simple and so immediate, into *Observation*, *Document*, and *Fable*, did not exist." This is because prior to this "signs were then part of things themselves, whereas in the seventeenth century they become modes of representation."

Tarnmoor footnote:

No conclusive source for Melville's one-off pen name has been determined, but Hershel Parker and William B. Dillingham suggest that "Salvatore R." is a reference to the Italian painter Salvator Rosa (Parker 2: 211, Dillingham 95). Dillingham suggests that "Tarnmoor" "has a certain wildness about it and a bleakness that fits the landscape described (95). Denise Tanyol proposes that "the Latinate name Salvator prefaces a surname, Tarnmoor, that conjures up not only the mountain tarns or lakes of Scandinavia (with their light-skinned people) but also the dark wasteland of the English heath and the dark skin of the Moors" (256).
