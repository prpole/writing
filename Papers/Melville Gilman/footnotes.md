[^1]: This excludes "Amblyrhyncus" in the front flap, which appears to be a post-hoc description of contents.

[^2]: Leposoma is a genus, and "Spix" refers to the source of the genus, an 1824 work on the natural history of Brazil. (*Notebooks* 430 n854). 

[^3]: In addition to giving Darwin the benefit of the doubt where scientific rigor is concerned, this supposition is based on the observations themselves, which mostly limit themselves to behaviors that can qualified as instinctual or are not represented as such.

[^3.1]: There is no verb in this latter fragmentary example, so of course the habitual present question does not apply in a literal sense; nevertheless the sense of the fragment implies the habitual present, in that "off with your jacket" can only be read as a repeated action or command (the pirates taking one's jacket or demanding that it be removed).

[^4]: See too beginning of passage qtd. in Christensen 245.

[^4.1]: 'The use of comparison, as much of anatomical structures as of their functions, permits Darwin to give account of the evolutionary processes in species.' (My translation.)

[^4.2]: Will be necessary to mark differences between my sense of this and Rosenberg's here

[^5]: Roughly, from the *Penguin Dictionary of Biology*: "For Lamarck the mechanism of evolutionary change was environmental: organs which assist an organism in its altered conditions are strengthened (e.g. the giraffe has acquired its high shoulders and long neck by straining to reach higher and higher into trees for leaves); others progressively atrophy through disuse. Such acquired characters, he thought, were then inherited. But there were and are no clear examples of such inheritance; nor does this theory account satisfactorily for evolutionary stability (stasis). It would require a theory of inheritance completely at variance with that receiving experimental support today" ("Lamarck, lamarckism")

[^6]: As Denise Tanyol has shown in her "Alternative Taxonomies of Melville's 'The Encantadas'"

[^7]: Tanyol makes a similar observation in her discussion of Rock Rodondo (259).
