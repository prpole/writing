#Epistemological authority as domination---for Melville---the crux
#
Note here that Melville is rendering meaning, classification, and
knowing as products purely of perception; and that perception to him is
not just the reflection of the observer, but *actually transforms* the
object into an image of the observer (see the passage on Cowley the
pirate, p. 326). Therefore in taxonomic or imperial
naming/classification systems, the sort of Kantian act of extending
one's individual perception and understanding (the will?) over some
object is denied, and in being so denied the individual is denied an
aspect of self-construction. So any definite aspect of classification
that does not allow subjective reworking is an act of domination over
the subsequent viewers/observers.	

#Darwin notes
Carl von Linné (Linnaeus 1707-1778) wrote: Nomina si nescis, perit cognitio rerum (If you ignore names, actual knowledge vanishes). ^[qtd. in Joy Unno 2009]

Pérez, Gutiérrez, y Segura 2007: 3. Comparación: Las comparaciones alcanzan un 11% de las observaciones; este método, sin ser el más utilizado, es sin embargo muy importante en el estudio del comportamiento ya que permite entender las bases comunes de la conducta en las diferentes especies. Así también, el uso de la comparación tanto de las estructuras anatómicas como de sus funciones, le permite a Darwin dar cuenta de los procesos evolutivos en las especies. ... Es importante señalar que este tipo de observación parece ser el resultado del trabajo posterior al viaje y que las comparaciones fueron incluidas en las ediciones del libro sobre el viaje. ^[514]
- for Darwin comparison is a fundamentally taxonomic act. In this sense, metaphor and classification become linked. If, as Pérez et al. say, Darwin's comparisons are strictly of anatomical features and functions within kingdoms (i.e., animal to animal, vegetable to vegetable, inorganic to inorganic) and Melville's are always outside of it (which prima facie I think holds up), then there's a case to be made for a fundamentally (epistemologically) subversive use of metaphor as an anti-taxonomic device. 
-a better way to put this, maybe: Darwin compares in order to identify two contiguous entries in a taxonomy (establish the taxonomic contiguity of two creatures?). Melville compares across taxonomic boundaries to show that such contiguity is incoherent.

causation in Darwin---note the frequent recourse to explanations and causes almost as a means of description (true in first edition?)

"tolerably luxuriant vegetation" Darwin 373

Darwin counting, measuring (eg 374) he measures like every damn thing

"This archipelago has long been frequented, first by Bucaniers, and latterly y whalers, but it is only within the last six years, that a small colony has been established here. The inhabitants are between two and three hundred in number: they are nearly all people of colour, who have been banished for political crimes from the Republic of the Equator, of which Quito is the capital."
- note banished rather than escaping in Darwin---emphasis on determination within a system versus self-determination

375 Darwin focuses on sustenance for humans as well as animals, but there's an element of participation in social systems that is only present in discussion of humans

"The whole of this northern part of Albemarle Island is miserably sterile" (376)

"the scene was altogether post picturesque and curious" 377

in Darwin's system the aboriginal is described and catalogued (even forming the basis of the system) but to Melville the aboriginal defies classification and seems to arise from the lack of classifiability 

Darwin "Most of the organic productions are aboriginal creatures, found nowhere else; there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the different islands; yet all show a marked relationship with those of America, though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600 miles in width." 377

note indigenous creatures get named according to the place to which they are indigenous (eg Mus Galapagoensis 378). "I can hardly doubt that this rat is merely a variety, produced by the new and peculiar climate, food, and soil, to which it has been subjected."

interaction of human systems of commerce and natural systems in the potential of Mus Galapagoensis to have arrived as a product of human transport---a weird kind of the anthropocene (2nd ed. only?)

"it might be fancied that a bird originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent." (380)

note that Darwin's account is structured by taxonomic family, while Melville's is structured according more or less to island, but in fact more conceptually (by act of mind, say)

"The following account…[will] show with what judgment Mr Bell foresaw a variation in habit, accompanying change in structure." (280) - behavior determined by physiognomy
	- see too Darwin's turtle riding adventure; takes the actions of one as indicative of the whole
	
"Hence, probably urged by a fixed and hereditary instinct that the shore is its place of safety, whatever the emergency may be, it there takes refuge." (281)

present habitual tense used almost exclusively in Darwin for description, grammatical implication of the actions of the community in the individual

"One is tempted to suppose this is an adaptation to their herbivorous appetites. It is very interesting thus to find a well-characterized genus, having its aquatic and terrestrial species, belonging to so confined a portion of the world" (285) --very interesting & bizarre; on one hand the gesture toward positing adaptation, on the other a scientifically cautious reluctance to. But then the delight in a symmetrical genus, in a pleasing model---Darwin responds here with a quiet interest to a situation where the reality leads to a certain result in his taxonomic system---or more specifically the visualization of it (in so far as the idea of symmetry is a largely visual idea). But note too that what pleases him is a symmetrical result in an already existing system. Therefore he is pleased by a result in a mental model of reality and not reality itself in this sense.
 - also re the above: on their being no frogs: "I was surprised at this, considering how well the temperate and damp woods in the elevated parts appeared adapted for their habits." (285)
 
"It would be impossible for any one accustomed to the birds of Chile and La Plata to be placed on these islands, and not to feel convinced that he was, as far as the organic world was concerned, on American ground." (286)
 - animal species defined by place (in naming) and place defined by species that exist there
 
on finches: "a nearly perfect gradation may be traced, from a beak extraordinarily thick, to one so fine, that it may be compared to that of a warbler" (287)
	- on one hand a kind of an obvious subjectivity in how one connects certain dots, but on the other hand an apparent situation in which apparently epistemologically stable classification leads to an error according to the methods of the system that is classifying...

"I very much suspect, that certain members of the series are confined to different islands; therefore, if the collection had been made on any *one* island, it would not have presented so perfect a gradation. It is clear, that if several islands have each their peculiar species of the same genera, when these are placed together, they will have a wide range of character. But there is not space in this work, to enter on this curious subject." (288)

The whole final paragraph (290):
the idea of "becom[ing] hereditary" of a certain "wildness" (he means caution)---I think this is only coherent within a Lamarckian framework. If the idea that learned behaviors are hereditary is what is at stake here, and it seems to be, then there's an implicit reliance on that framework in lieu of anything else to supplant it. The idea of species learning versus individual learning is much of what's at stake here. Even the word "learning" will become incoherent in a post-*Origin* Darwinian framework. Learning implies a cognition with relation to memory that, to think of human for the moment as *mammalia* and not as conceptually distinct, is only present in certain species. It is to some extent a generous estimation of cross-family cognition, but we have no reason to suspect an accurate one.

in notebooks: single line about the society of one of the islands: "Anarchical state" (432 [25a])
	- note for what it's worth that there is no description of how the thing works, only classification
