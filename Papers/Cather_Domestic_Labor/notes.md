# Becoming Modern - use for biographical stuff and wondering what Cather's own thoughts on domesticity were

- Cather's paternal grandmother took as her motto, "A change of work is rest" (qtd. in Downs 32)
- "Perhaps thinking of her grandmother, Cather always worried that an 'artist' was a person who did no 'sanctioned' work. Cather insistently made her writing not just an avocation, but a profession, with regular hours and duties" (33). 
- "If, for Cather's grandmother, 'real work' had to take precedence in her life, and Cather at this age found housework worthless toil, could not one's art be considered 'real' work?" (35).
- "By aligning herself with male critics and authors...and by going to school, Cather gave herself a profession, removing herself from the round of housekeeping, pregnancy, and illness that she saw as limiting a woman's life" (42). 
- At college "Cather continued to distance herself from a culture of women, who, out of necessity or desire, did not seek employment outside of their homes. Cather felt that domesticity undermined her career" (46).
- As an editor of Home Monthly, she signed different (and differently gendered) names to write on different topics. This caused her to take up topics mostly of interest to the groups with which she least wanted to identify, women whose only labor was domestic. To write for such a market, Downs suggests, seh adopted "a deliberately 'feminine' voiceâ€¦to elaborate feminine ideologies and obligations and for the first time perhaps, to create meaning from these for herself" (69). 
- Romines 135, on the house/work divide in cather's life, qtd. in Downs 69.
- Cather's masculine journlaistic voices "By writing about adventure stories, Cather could write about the other world outside the home, worlds forbidden to proper Helens. Helen although seated by her fireside, voyaged to foreign lands in the books she discussed" (73). 

# Reynolds "Modernist Space"

- On the grass coming up to the door: "grass grows right up to the door, creating a seamless connection with the terrain" (5)
- Argues that Cather posits a specific connection between aesthetic, landscape, and domestic/built spaces in her fiction. She believed that "regional geography genertes literary form" (9) according to reynolds
- Connection with environment also tends to mark a valuation of privacy, though why/how is unclear. "inward and sheltered"
- for Cather...the connection between environment and privacy seems to have had the force of an equation: in creating an organic space...one also fashioned an intensely private realm.
- "Although the novels explore, on one level, mastery over landscape...line by line and paragraph by paragraph Cather is fascinated by a quotidian, anti-heroic interplay between self and environment" (16-7)

#Tom Outland

"To people off alone, as we were, there is something stirring about finding evidences of human labour and care in the soil of an empty country. It comes to you as a sort of message, makes you feel differently about the ground you walk over every day. I liked the winter range better than any place I'd ever been in. I never came out of the cabin door in the morning to go after water that I didn't feel fresh delight in our snug quarters and the river and the old mesa up there, with its top burning like a bonfire." (194 Vintage) (cf 221 v)



"They were probably wiped out, utterly exterminated, by some roving Indian tribe without culture or domestic virtues, some horde that fell upon them in their summer camp and destroyed them for their hides and clothing and weapons, or from mere love of slaughter." (221 v) 

    - domestic virtues are apparently the connection with environment; see "buitl themselves into this mesa and humanized it"; connection with space both replaces and defines the social, somehow. Think of the way that domestic labor ends up being both social and spatial.

##Cabin

"facing south and sheltered on the north by a low hill" (189 v)
    
    - shelter makes cabin mirror cliff city?

"There was no litter around, it was as clean as a prairie-dog's house. ...It was the sort of place a man would like to stay in forever." (189 v)

mesa "overhanging" cabin, mirrors SP's office? emphasis on height (189 v)

First thing when they enter the cabin, housekeeping. Tom: "I confess I looked forward to cooking on an iron stove with four holes." (189-90 v) why confess? Never addressed, without context.

##Garden

"A fringe of cedars grew along the edge of the cavern, like a garden." (201 v) cliff-city's garden links to SP's house

outland story ends with "I landed here and walked into your garden, and the rest you know." (253 v). Anything to this structural position of the garden?

##Cliff dwelling in general

"The notion stuck me like a rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a bee-hive; it was full of little cliff-hung villages, it had been the home of a powerful tribe, a particular civilization." (202 v)

    - bee-hive suggests certain organizational and communal practice in addition to structure

"The town in the cliffs explained the irrigation ditches. Like all pueblo Indians, these people had had their farms away from their dwellings. For a stronghold they needed rock, and for farming, soft earth and a water main." (203 v) 

    - literal separation of work and home

"It was evidently a kind of communal kitchen, where they roasted and baked and probably gossiped." (209 v)

    - communal labor dismantles the usual bourgeois heterosexual division of labor
    - cf Tom's confession of looking forward to cooking


##anti-heterosexist family

"Henry like to talk about his family, and the work they'd done, and the great age to which they lived, and the brandy puddings his mother made....Roddy and I used to strain our imagination trying to visualize such a family dinner party." (206 v) 

    - the family imaginary repurposed to bring together the homosocial family

##Housekeeping explicitly

On the cliff-dwelling:

    - "everything seemed open and clean" (208 v)
    - "there was little rubbish or disorder. As Blake remarked, wind and sun are good house-keepers." (208)
    - "We brought old Henry up by the new horse-trail and began housekeeping. We were now ready for what we called excavating." (211 v)
    - "Henry, besides doing the housekeeping, was very eager to help us in the 'rew-ins,' as he called them. He was more patient than we, and would dig with his fingers half a day to get a pot out of a rubbish pile without breaking it. After all, the old man had a wider knowledge of the world than either of us, and it came in handy." (212 v)
        - explicit link of his facility with housekeeping, excavating, and his knowledge of the world. 
    - "we cleared up any litter we'd made in digging things out, stored all the specimens, even the mummies, in our cabin, and padlocked the doors and windows before we left it." (223 v)
        - NOTE that this even more explicitly doubles the cabin and the cliff-city.

##Design

"There is unquestionably a distinct feeling for design in what you call the Cliff City. Buildings are not grouped like that by pure accident, though convenience probably had much to do with it. Convenience often dictates very sound design."

    - emphasis on purposive construction of space

"Your people were cut off here without the influence of example or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and security. They built themselves into this mesa and humanized it." (221 v) (cf 194 v) 

    - could just as easily be about this ad hoc family as anything, tom henry roddy. could argue that this "your people" posits this shared sensibility as the basis of Tom's identification with the cliff-city
