Housekeepers keep showing up in unexpected places in *The Professor's House*. It may be more precise to say in "unexpected *forms*": among the many housekeepers we have Henry Atkins, a "castaway Englishman" who cooks and cleans for traveling cowboys and shepherds (196 v); the impromptu archaeologists Tom and Roddy, for whom "excavating" and "housekeeping" become inextricably linked (211 v); even the "wind and sun," which, as Roddy puts it, "are good house-keepers" for the preserved cliff city (208 v). The uses housekeeping is put to are even more surprising than its pecular forms, though, for these are uses that go far beyond what one might think of as good housekeeping. Many of the tasks domestic labor performs in *The Professor's House* are in fact tasks more usually reserved for the historian. The wind and sun tidy up the mesa's cliff city, but in doing so they also keep it "preserved...like a fly in amber," making the lost civilization it embodies accessible centuries later (202 v). The "housekeeping" that Tom, Roddy, and Henry perform in the city continues this work, not only excavating but further guarding the city's objects, effectively turning them into artifacts. Finally, only St. Peter's jealously guarded rituals of domestic labor in arranging and maintaining his attic office enable him to transmit Tom's experience of the cliff city to the historical archive---and in the end, Tom's account is the only form in which the city will remain intact. But why would Willa Cather have domestic labor underwrite the pursuit of historical knowledge? How do these peculiarly capacious forms of domesticity relate to the more traditional, heterosexist versions that are also represented in the novel? And in what ways does this hybrid of domestic and historical labor end up redefining both?

I intend to argue here[^a] that to understand domestic labor's relation to history as a discipline we have to understand it as a simultaneous construction of space and of social forms. In many places in the novel, queering housekeeping becomes a way to narratively dissolve the heterosexist division of labor, but because of its dual nature it also becomes a means for constructing queer *spaces*. Housekeeping and history-making are able to be combined because, in Cather's versions of them, they each trouble the separation of productive labor and domestic labor by their position between the two types. The productive nature of history is shown to rely on and concern itself with certain domestic paradigms, while those domestic paradigms are repurposed to become productive. The history-housekeeping hybrid, then, becomes a kind of work that disrupts the binary of work inside and outside of the home, a division that previous research suggests Cather found oppressive throughout her life.[^1] Finally, this understanding of the domestic elements of historical knowledge will allow me to recontextualize Tom's perplexing identification with the cliff city. Reading his own queer domesticity in relation to the traces he uncovers in the mesa reveals a form of historical knowledge based on transhistorical cultural identification, a form willfully ignorant of nation and genealogy.[^2] Building on Caroline Levine's recent work in *Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, Network*, I will suggest that this identification is based on the recognition of his own disruptive social form (the queer domestic arrangement with Roddy) in the spatial organization of the cliff city.

[To begin this exploration today, I am just going to look at a few passages that will be central to my reading of the Outland portion of the novel. This will necessarily ignore the more traditional heterosexist division of labor that I'm claiming Cather intends to subvert, but it will establish what I see as her rebuttal to it and the sense in which domestic construction of space is also social construction. These paragraphs will probably appear somewhere in the first part of the paper, but there will be more setup in terms of existing criticism and perhaps Levine.]

The housekeeping that is recognizable as such in "Tom Outland's Story" forms the foundation of a monogamous family-like social structure that might be taken as a classic homosocial relationship.[^3] As Marilee @lindemann_willa_1999 points out, it is both a "queering...of the American classic as the tale of a free boy's adventures" and an alternative to a heterosexual family: Tom, Roddy, and Henry "can make of themselves 'a happy family'...devising their own patterns of living, working, and caring for one another without interference from the other world below" (103). What this reading does not account for, however, is that this alternative to the heterosexual family is explicitly developed and maintained through the evolving structure of the men's domestic labor. Life in the cabin develops on a trajectory from a state of natural, disordered cleanliness to a state of *human*, domestic cleanliness. And as this shift in the space occurs, the social structure with which it is mutually constitutive becomes increasingly queered. 

The first type of domesticity maps closely with masculinist adventure stories that Lindemann suggests Cather is "queering," in that it recalls hackneyed tropes of a man or men in uneasy harmony with "nature"---a relationship at times contestatory, at times transcendent, but always manly. Cather's version of this trope, though, is filtered through the narrative construction of the home, and in her hands the porous man-nature boundary of the adventure genre becomes a porous home-nature boundary. When Tom and Roddy arrive, the landscape itself has already compromised any clear distinction of the out-of-doors from the home and family: "The grama grass grew right up to the door-step, and the rabbits were running about and the grasshoppers hitting the door.... There was no litter around, it was as clean as a prairie-dog's house" (187). The outside is trying to get inside; or rather, the outside is trying to *become* the inside. This home sheltered by the mesa establishes a liminal space between the familiar dichotomy of adventuring, nature and culture. As such, it has its own standards of domesticity, as in the peculiar cleanliness established by the intrusion of the natural. Like the cliff city that has "wind and sun" for "house-keepers," the cabin is tidy and carefully ordered without being "clean" in a human, domestic sense. And although it cannot be taken as clean in the sense familiar to domestic standards, the comparison to a prairie-dog's house demands re-thinking of what it means to "make a home": just as the prairie-dog fashions its own home out of the earth, Tom and Roddy fashion their cabin out of a space whose naturalness Cather insists upon. This animalistic paradigm of space-construction maps, curiously, to one of the only occasions when the domestic arrangement is specifically gendered. To conclude the paragraph that defines the oscillation between home and landscape, Tom dubs the setting "the sort of place a man would like to stay in forever" (187). The masculine version of domesticity with which Cather begins in the Outland chapter---that is, a version still recognizable within a heterosexist set of identities---is finally recognized as no kind of domesticity at all. Contemplating the cabin's crude "cook-stove," Tom looks forward yearningly "to cooking on an iron stove with four holes" (188). It is a wish that will not be possible in the space like this one that is so heavily defined by its liminality.

The relationship between the two men may be masculine and homosocial in terms of gender, but in its division of labor it remains distinctly heterosexist. That is, it does not disrupt the productive-domestic labor binary structurally, instead merely allowing fluidity in which partner is able to inhabit those roles. Tom and Roddy develop a system of alternation between the productive and the domestic: "One man was with the herd while the other got his sleep and did the cooking at the cabin. The mesa was our only neighbor, and the closer we got to it, the more tantalizing it was" (189). The men take turns as housekeeper and worker, and although the temporality of the bourgeois working day is disrupted, the roles that support it continue to exist as a binary. The monolithic mesa, humanized as a silent neighbor, stands over the gap where another person (or other people) would be. It is not immediately clear why this abrupt transition occurs to neighborlessness in general, however, or why the mesa is so "tantalizing." The turn can certainly, in part, be explained by the lack of any company but each other's and a longing for adventure, but it serves a different function narratively. It establishes negatively a third element that would, and will, break the frame of a binary social relationship, and its appearance at this moment anticipates the communal structures they will find in the mesa itself. 

Henry's sudden appearance fills the void pointed out by the neighborly mesa, and by displacing the naturalistic housekeeping of the homosocial adventure tale, he ruptures the heterosexist labor binary and queers the entire domestic space. No longer is the cabin a "prairie-dog's house," but it is not a suburban living room, either. Instead, it becomes something entirely new:

> Life was a holiday for Blake and me after we got old Henry. He was a wonderful cook and a good housekeeper. He kept that cabin shining like a playhouse; used to dress it all out with pi√±on boughs, and trimmed the kitchen shelves with newspapers cut in fancy patterns. He had learned to make up cots when he was a hospital orderly, and he made our bunks feel like a Harvey House bed. To this day that's the best I can say for any bed. And he was such a polite, mannerly old boy; simple and kind as a child. I used to wonder how anybody so innocent and defenceless had managed to get along at all, to keep alive for nearly seventy years in as hard a world as this. Anybody could take advantage of him. (195)

The "holiday" of life with Henry is a state of exception from the normal capitalist, heterosexual order. Similarly, the extent to which the cabin becomes a "playhouse" both disrupts the necessary endurance of masculine adventuring and the sense of the "home" as a space in dialectical relation with "work," establishing it as a third space that enables the ludic and the child-like. Henry's place in this revision of the family is partially that of the child (pure beneficiary of productive labor and source of play) and wife (the uncompensated domestic laborer and manager of the home). [more about the structure?]

It is essential for the queering of the family that his own role not map onto any of these roles, as Cather's refusal to let it do so is the means by which the labor binary is ruptured. Henry's labor is domestic, but because the structure separating productive labor and domestic labor has been broken, his work is able to be imported into the productive sphere. When Tom and Roddy are finally able to begin excavating the cliff city in earnest, Henry comes with them as a collaborator without abandoning his nature as a housekeeper. His inclusion among the productive labors of Tom and Roddy end up changing the nature of the work itself, as their amateur archaeology begins to take on the lexicon of domestic labor.

> We brought old Henry up by the new horse-trail and began housekeeping. We were now ready for what we called excavating....Henry, besides doing the housekeeping, was very eager to help us in the 'rew-ins,' as he called them. He was more patient than we, and would dig with his fingers half a day to get a pot out of a rubbish pile without breaking it. After all, the old man had a wider knowledge of the world than either of us, and it came in handy. (211-2 v)

In some ways, of course, Henry remains unequal in the three-way relationship. Where Tom and Roddy are exploring as partners, he is still "brought," a refusal of any legitimately agentive action. Henry's restriction from agency differs from the way children or wives would be forbidden agency in the corresponding heterosexual family, though, because 

In the gap between these two sentences, Cather makes space for the introduction of Henry, the person who will become their new "neighbor" and disrupt the familiar but unsatisfactory monogamous binary of domestic and productive labor. [Henry's appearance will displace the landscape as a housekeeper and satisfy their desire for something to push the domestic relationship beyond the heterosexist division of labor. It is no coincidence that Henry's appearance narratively enables their passage into the mesa, which itself becomes a receptacle for their utopian domestic desires.]

# Still to come in the Harry/Mesa section: 

 - Harry the Housekeeper initiates a kind of family not possible in homosocial relationship; also narratively enables the entry to the mesa.

 - Way in which housekeeping literally uncovers the secrets of the mesa and its community; archaeology rendered as housekeeping.

 - connection between the city's organization and the social structures it implies. Reading of space.

 - The defeat of queer domesticity: Harry's death coinciding with the narrative of the civilization's destruction by those without "domestic virtue"

# Other Sections

 - The mesa/cabin's connection to St. Peter's room, more generally domestic labor enabling historical pursuit financially. Need more about history as itself a liminal domestic/productive space?

 - Expanding on Levine to talk about the mutual influence of space/social forms/historical forms. The idea is that each of these establishes a closed and self-sustaining system based on domestic labor structures larger (or other) than the family. Can I argue that this is really a "form"? How narrow does it have to get?

## Other important quotes


- "To people off alone, as we were, there is something stirring about finding evidences of human labour and care in the soil of an empty country. It comes to you as a sort of message, makes you feel differently about the ground you walk over every day. I liked the winter range better than any place I'd ever been in. I never came out of the cabin door in the morning to go after water that I didn't feel fresh delight in our snug quarters and the river and the old mesa up there, with its top burning like a bonfire." (194 Vintage) (cf 221 v)



- "They were probably wiped out, utterly exterminated, by some roving Indian tribe without culture or domestic virtues, some horde that fell upon them in their summer camp and destroyed them for their hides and clothing and weapons, or from mere love of slaughter." (221 v) 

    - domestic virtues are apparently the connection with environment; see "built themselves into this mesa and humanized it"; connection with space both replaces and defines the social, somehow. Think of the way that domestic labor ends up being both social and spatial.

## Cliff dwelling in general

- "The notion stuck me like a rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a bee-hive; it was full of little cliff-hung villages, it had been the home of a powerful tribe, a particular civilization." (202 v)

    - bee-hive suggests certain organizational and communal practice in addition to structure

- "The town in the cliffs explained the irrigation ditches. Like all pueblo Indians, these people had had their farms away from their dwellings. For a stronghold they needed rock, and for farming, soft earth and a water main." (203 v) 

    - literal separation of work and home

- "It was evidently a kind of communal kitchen, where they roasted and baked and probably gossiped." (209 v)

    - communal labor dismantles the usual bourgeois heterosexual division of labor
    - cf Tom's confession of looking forward to cooking

## Design

- "There is unquestionably a distinct feeling for design in what you call the Cliff City. Buildings are not grouped like that by pure accident, though convenience probably had much to do with it. Convenience often dictates very sound design."

    - emphasis on purposive construction of space

- "Your people were cut off here without the influence of example or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and security. They built themselves into this mesa and humanized it." (221 v) (cf 194 v) 

    - could just as easily be about this ad hoc family as anything, tom henry roddy. could argue that this "your people" posits this shared sensibility as the basis of Tom's identification with the cliff-city

When Cather uses housekeeping to reconstruct space, then, she does so as a way to reconstruct gendered social relationships.
