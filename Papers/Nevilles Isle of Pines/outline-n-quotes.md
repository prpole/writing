"The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.

Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others." 
--John Locke, *Second Treatise of a Civil Government*, Sec. 26-7

The tension between an Edenic environment that provides without the intervention of labor and the cultivated environment consistent with colonizing ultimately stages a conflict between the colonial expectation of leisure on one hand and the requirements of both property and morality on the other. Ultimately, the work concludes with a call to possession through cultivation while still maintaining the promise of leisurely abundance; this contradiction of land cultivation and leisurely lifestyle can only be resolved by the slave economy that such colonies would eventually take up. The text of Henry Neville's *The Isle of Pines* is therefore a unique case study in the promises made to would-be settlers that can only be resolved by slavery.




"length all on a ſuddn the Wind ceaſed, and the Air cleared, the Clouds were all diſperſed," (14)

"wherein fell a little River, which being encompaſſed by the Rocks, was ſheltered from the Wind, ſo" (18)

1. "we were at firſt affraid that the wild people of the Countrey might find us out, although we ſaw no footſteps of any, nor ſo much as a Path; the Woods round about being full of Briers and Brambles, we alſo ſtood in fear of wild Beaſts, of ſuch alſo we ſaw none, nor ſign of any: But above all, and that we had greateſt reaſon to fear, was to be ſtarved to death for want of Food, but God had otherwiſe provided for us, as you ſhall know hereafter;" (18)

"we found on Land a ſort of fowl about the bigneſs of a Swan, very heavy and fat, that by reaſon of their weight could not fly, of theſe we found little difficulty to kill, ſo that they were our preſent food; we carried out of England certain Hens and Cocks to eat by the way, ſome of theſe when the ſhip was broken, by ſome means got to land, and bred exceedingly, ſo that in the future they were a great help unto us; we found alſo, by a little River, in the flags, store of eggs, of a ſort of fowl much like our Ducks, which were very good meat, ſo that we wanted nothing to keep us alive." (19)

"But on the contrary the countrey ſo very pleaſant, being always clothed with green, and full of pleaſant fruits, and variety of birds, ever warm, and never colder then in England in September: So that this place (had it the culture, that skilful people might beſtow on it) would prove a Paradiſe. 

"The woods afforded us a ſort of Nuts, as big as a large Apple, whoſe kernel being pleasant and dry, we made uſe of inſtead of bread, that fowl before mentioned, and a ſort of water-fowl like Ducks, and their eggs, and a beaſt about the ſize of a Goat, and almoſt ſuch a like creature, which brought two young ones at a time, and that twice a year, of which the Lowlands and Woods were very full, being a very harmleſs creature and tame, ſo that we could eaſily take and kill them: Fiſh, also, eſpecially Shell-fiſh (which we could beſt come by) we had great ſtore of, ſo that in effect as to Food we wanted nothing; and thus, and by ſuch like helps, we continued ſix moneths, without any diſturbance or want." (19)

"heard the delightful harmony of ſinging Birds, the ground very fertile in Trees, Graſs, and ſuch Flowers as grow by the production of Nature, without the help of Art; many and ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts we ſaw, who were not ſo much wild as in other Countries;" (24)

"It was very ſtrange to us, to ſee that in ſuch a fertile Countrey which was as yet never inhabited, there ſhould be notwithstanding ſuch a free and clear paſſage to us, without the hinderance of Buſhes, Thorns, and ſuch like ſtuff, wherewith moſt Iſlands of the like nature are peſtered: the length of the Graſs (which yet was very much intermixt with flowers) being the only impediment that we found." (25)

2.
"ſo wondering at our ſhip, as if it had been the greateſt miracle of Nature in whole World. 

"We were very courteouſly entertained by them, preſenting us with ſuch food as that Countrey afforded, which indeed was not to be deſpiſed; we eat of the Flesh both of Beaſts, and Fowls, which they had cleanly dreſt, though with no great curioſity, as wanting materials, wherewithal to do it; and for bread we had the inſide or Kernel of a great Nut as big as an Apple, which was very wholſome, and ſound for the body, and taſted to the Pallat very delicious." (15)

"we got all our cutting Inſtruments on Land, and fell to hewing down of trees, with which, in a little time, (many hands making light work) we built up a Pallace for this William Pines the Lord of that Countrey; which, though much inferiour to the houſes of your Gentry in England. Yet to them which never had ſeen better, it appeared a very Lordly Place. This deed of ours was beyond expreſſion acceptable unto him, loading us with thanks for ſo great a benefit, of which he ſaid he ſhould never be able to make a requital." (26)

"preferring (as he ſaid) his own Countrey Water before all ſuch Liquors whatſoever." (26)

"had no other then only Vocal Muſick" (26)

"where was nothing wanting in what we could do to entertain him, he had about a dozen of Servants to attend on him; he much admired at the Tacklings of our Ship, but when we came to diſcharge a piece or two of Ordnance, it ſtruck him into a wonder and amazement to behold the ſtrange effects of Powder; he was very ſparing in his Diet, neither could he, or any of his followers be induced to drink any thing but Water:" (26)

3. "bigneſs of one of our ordinary village houſes, it was ſupported with rough unhewn pieces of Timber, and covered very artificially with boughs, ſo that it would keep out the greateſt ſhowers of Rain; the ſides thereof were adorned with ſeveral ſorts of Flowers, which the fragrant fields there do yield in great variety." (15)

"We carried him as a preſent ſome few Knives, of which we thought they had great need, an Ax or Hatchet to fell Wood, which was very acceptable unto him, the old one which was caſt on ſhore at firſt, and the only one that they ever had, being now ſo quite blunt and dulled, that it could not cut at all, ſome few other things we alſo gave him, which he very thankfully accepted," (16)

"to range further in the diſcovery of the Countrey, which they found anſwerable to their deſires, full both of Fowls and Beaſts, and thoſe too not hurtful to mankinde, as if this Country (on which we were by providence caſt without arms or other weapons to defend our ſelves, or offend others,) ſhould by the ſame providence be ſo inhabited as not to have any need of ſuch like weapons of deſtruction wherewith to preſerve our lives." (22)

4. "Her privities were hid with ſome pieces of old Garments, the Relicts of those Cloathes (I ſuppose) of them which firſt came hither, and yet being adorned with Flowers thoſe very rags seemeth beautiful; and indeed modeſty ſo far prevaileth over all the Female Sex of that Iſland, that with graſs and flowers interwoven and made ſtrong by the peelings of young Elms (which grow there in great plenty) they do plat together ſo many of them as ſerve to cover thoſe parts which nature would have hidden." (16-7)

"they were all handſome Women, when they had Cloathes, and well ſhaped, feeding well. For we wanted no Food, and living idlely, and ſeeing us at Liberty to do our wills, without hope of ever returning home, made us thus bold:" (20)

"ſo that wanting now nothing but Cloathes, nor them much neither, other then for decency, the warmth of the Countrey and Cuſtome ſupplying that Defect, we were now well ſatisfied with our condition, our Family beginning to grow large, and there being nothing to hurt us, we many times lay abroad on Moſſey Banks, under the ſhelter of ſome Trees, or ſuch like (for having nothing elſe to do) I had made me ſeveral Arbors to ſleep in with my Women in the heat of the day," (20)

5. "Now as Seed being caſt into ſtinking Dung produceth good and wholeſome Corn for the ſuſtentation of mans life, ſo bad manners produceth good and wholeſome laws for the preſervation of Humane Society." (23)

"my eldeſt Boy to mind the ordinary work of Nature, by ſeeing what we did, I gave him a Mate, and" (20)

"moſt of my children being grown, as faſt as we married them, I ſent them and placed them over the River by themſelves ſeverally," (20)

"I having taught ſome of my children to read formerly, for I had left ſtill the Bible, I charged it ſhould be read once a moneth at a general meeting:" (21)

6. "ſo that what my Grand-father was forced to do for neceſſity, they did for wontonneſs;" (22)

"Some trees bearing wild Fruits we alſo ſaw, and of thoſe ſome whereof we taſted, which were neither unwholſome nor diſtaſteful to the Pallate, and no queſtion had but Nature here the benefit of Art added unto it, it would equal, if not exceed many of our Europian Countries; the Vallyes were every where intermixt with running ſtreams, and no queſtion but the Earth hath in it rich veins of Minerals, enough to ſatisfie the deſires of the moſt covetous." (25)

Final tension (juxtapose passages): "though they have not that happy means to expreſs themſelves; in this reſpect we may account them fortunate, in that poſſeſſing little, they enjoy all things, as being contented with what they have, wanting thoſe alurements to miſchief, which our European Countries are enriched with. I ſhall not dilate any further, no queſtion but time will make this Iſland known better to the world; all that I ſhall ever ſay of it is, that it is a place enriched with Natures abundance, deficient in nothing conducible to the ſuſtentation of mans life, which were it Manured by Agri‑culture and Gardening, as other of our European Countries are, no queſtion but it would equal, if not exceed many which now paſs for praiſe worthy."
