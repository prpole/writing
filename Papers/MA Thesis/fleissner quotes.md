5: Henry Adams as naturalist historian because he gets away from “a notion of a known-in-advance “nature” lost or refound---toward a new understanding of nature as evolution saw it, as itself an ever-changing part of history’s story” (5)

5: this is the sense that she extends to Norris Dreiser & naturalist novelists

5-6: extends it to “‘nature’ newly fashioned into an ‘ism,’ a category to be reconceived as part of *social* life” (5-6).

6: The modern woman can emblematize this shifting sense of nature’s relation to social-historical time [that comes from evolutionary theory], for, as Adams shows, she herself represents that part of life once conceived as timelessly ‘inert’ which can now be seen stepping forth onto the stage of history” (6). Therefore “how she might come to ‘know herself’ (to use Adams’s words), becomes the major focus of narrative interest for the naturalist text” (6).

6: contends that “our treatment of naturalism has remained limited by a tendency to reduce its meanings to the two more polarized responses to the 1890s” with naturalism thus “seen as either fatalistic or nostalgic in the face of modern life” (6).

6-7: “Fatalistic” strain “depicts individuals bereft of agency or vitality,” usually in relation to some larger systemic or urban context, and narratively tends toward “plots of decline” (6). In “nostalgic” strain “naturalism goes along with a renewal of what Roosevelt called ‘the strenuous life,’ returning masculine power and adventure to a vitiated modernity by rediscovering the freedoms and struggles associated with a still wide-open, untarnished natural landscape. (Surprisingly, the reading of naturalism as ‘social Darwinist’ fiction can go along with the more optimistic latter story, in that nature, left to its own devices, will sort out who belongs on top.)” (7)
