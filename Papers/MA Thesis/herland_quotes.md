"It's a pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it," Jeff said. (42)

It appeared to be well forested about the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and everywhere parklike meadows and open places.
	There were cities, too; that I insisted. It looked---well, it looked like any other country---a civilized one, I mean. (42)
	
"Semi-tropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It's wonderful what a little height will do for temperature." Terry was studying the forest growth. (42)

We saw...a land in a state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only that it was even more evidently an enormous garden.... I confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads, to the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little town. (42)

"I never saw a forest so petted, even in Germany. Look, there's not a dead bough---the vines are trained---actually! And see here"---he stopped and looked about him, calling Jeff's attention to the kind of trees.
	They left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side.
	"Food-bearing, practically all of them," they announced returning. "The rest splendid hard-wood. Call this a forest? It's a truck farm!"(44)
	
These towering trees were under as careful cultivation as so many cabbages. (44)

*on birds*: "some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost to contradict our theory of cultivation" (44)

The broad green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and narrower paths besides. (47)

The road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to shed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it were Europe's best. "No men, eh?" sneered Terry. On either side a double row of trees shaded the footpaths, between the trees bushes or vines, all fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains, everywhere flowers. (48)	

"We'd better import some of these ladies and set 'em to parking the United States," I suggested. (48)

...impressed, for all our gay bravado by the sense of quiet potency which lay about us. (48)

Here was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids. (48)

"They've got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that's sure," agreed Terry. (49)

I have often groaned at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature.... (49)

*anti-urbanism*: "There's no dirt," said Jeff suddenly. "There's no smoke," he added after a little.
	"There's no noise," I offered; but Terry snubbed me---"That's because they are laying low for us...."(49)
	
Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness and the pleasantest sense of home over it all. As we neared the center of the town the houses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling palaces grouped among parks and open squares something as college buildings stand in their quiet greens. (49)

Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of castle, built out on a steep spur of rock. Immediately below us were gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot.(58)

*Terry describes herlanders as* "Great aunts" *---reference to beechers?*

Our time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the cliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced that the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely as mosaics. (60)

They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books, but colored studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools and various small objects---we had plenty of "material" in our school. (62)

forest referred to as "the cultivated area" 66

Sometimes we were near the outer edge [of Herland], and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths beyond. (66)
	"This piece of geography stands up like a basalt column," Jeff said. (66-7)
	
Mighty lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did. Even that margin of forest seemed rich in food-stuffs. *note: in the "adventure" section; part III?*

*Versus land beyond:* The wall at that point was singularly uninviting. It rose so straight that we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below seemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation. (67)

This was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw of it, the better I liked it. We went too swiftly for close observation, but I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the shade of endless lines of trees, the ribbon of flowers that unrolled beneath them, and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and away, full of varied charm. (71)

We rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the park-like beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. (71)

*link to kitchenless households:* we went in to eat, in a big garden place, with little shaded tables among the trees and flowers... (71)

*Early Herlanders:* Their farms and gardens were all in full production. Such industries as they had were in careful order. (83)

When we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our field glasses. There it was, about four miles off, the same town we concluded, unless as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses. The broad green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and narrower paths besides. â€¦[C]lose to town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued figures were running swiftly.
	"How could they have got that far, in this time? It can't be the same ones," I urged. But through the glasses we could identify our pretty tree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume.
