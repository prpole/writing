In the first section, I will explore Gilman's conception of the garden as space, both in terms of allocation of agricultural resources and design of unified urban, communal, and household spaces. This discussion will lead to a comparison with Ebenezer Howard's contemporaneous garden city movement, which drew on many of the works that influenced *Herland*. Taking the garden as an organizing principle ties this controlled space to control of what develops in it: in the next section, I will show that Gilman's idiosyncratic depiction of biological evolution develops in tandem with the social division of the factory. Labor specialization becomes speciation, and distinct social roles develop into distinct organisms; this speciation in turn leads to the collective gardener's willful cultivation of literal and social species, by a complicated system of eugenics, according to *Herland*'s utopian vision.
