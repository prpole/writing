by visually representing the novel in this way, I hope to show the failure of place narrowly understood in accounting for the novel. In other words, that the characters have to be understood as not just individuals, but also the objects that they put into circulation, or that put *them* into circulation, or that otherwise extend the boundaries of the individual in some way. This vision of prosthetic humanity that the novel puts forward, I'll argue, is the only way to reconcile the coincidence of economic-slash-environmental calamity with the resolution on the human narrative.

#Space, Material, Things

In Zygmunt Bauman's "Living (Occasionally Dying) in an Urban World," he presents a conception of space that has emerged with---and may be coextensive with---globalization and global capitalism. Extending Maneul Castells's "space of flows," he puts his focus on the spatial dimension "where global powers reside and operate," in which 

>it is the *speed of movement and facility to escape*, not the size of *territorial possessions* (and so responsibilities), that count and decide.… New empires are not of this world---not of earthly, geographical world, not of the "space of places." (112)

Although his focus here is primarily on territoriality itself, his "space of flows" can also provide a way to discuss materiality in terms both of spatial understanding, and in the context of a global market. Is the international object, which is built in one place specifically to be shipped to and used in another, the same as the object used by the person who builds it, and which is used primarily where it was built? If territorial possession is anathema to global power, what about the possessions that define the territory? In Bauman's primarily geographical account of the space of flows, a more fundamental view of power and materiality remains unstated, but is nevertheless constitutive. Namely, that global power is greater the less it is constrained by individual materiality. Put another way: power can increase to a global scale only to the extent that it can operate without material limitations. 

Much of the discussion around Castells's original concept, including Castells's own,^[Footnote 2009 article] has centered on "cyberspace" as a new spatial paradigm and a way "that the material arrangements allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity" (Castells 295). To place emphasis exclusively on information technologies and increasing territory-agnostic social practices is to risk missing a more fundamental dematerializing operation that, while intimately related to technological progress, is not exclusively defined by it. It would not be correct to simplify this dematerializing force and name it "capitalism"; nevertheless, Marx did not need an E-Trade account to write, "All that is solid melts into air." Commodity logic has dematerialization built into it as the spectral side of value, and as such the turn away from material, even if it is a turn to "social practices," can be fruitfully understood through the filter of material things. Put another way, we might add to Arjun Appadurai's interaction of the five "scapes"---ethnoscapes, technoscapes, finanscapes, mediascapes, and ideoscapes---another element: the "commodiscape" or the global circulation of material commodities. Just as the other five scapes are mutually necessary to understand global flows because "global flows occur…*in and through the growing disjunctures between*" them, the commodiscape also participates in and disjoints the multiscape of globalization. After all, commodities are *material* in their usefulness as objects, but they are also *financial* in their exchange value and their financialization as commodities futures. They are *technological* in the means of their production and the increasingly technological elements of the things themselves. They are *affective* in our non-market attachments to things.^[See Bill Brown's misuse value, discussed below? ()] They are *mediatized* and *ideological* in their use as images of mass culture and nationalism (think of the Ford). Finally, and crucially for my purposes, commodities are *environmental* in the way their use and disposal (un-use) impacts the material flows, the ecological substratum that gets ignored in the exchange of commodities, but without which there is nothing. The *space of things* sits in between the space of flows and the space of places. Though things, like people, get caught up in flows and are all the more powerful the less they are rooted to a particular territory (the "global brand"), they do come from some *place*. And just as important on a full planet, they end up someplace.

Karen Tei Yamashita's *Through the Arc of the Rainforest* can be read as a surreal, comedic, but nonetheless sophisticated demonstration of a similar principal, as globalism's relationship to space is mirrored in the novel's treatment of circulation. Another layer of complexity is added, however, in the relationship of people to things, and the way this relationship mediates human interaction with larger systems in the multiscape of global flows. This mediation is allowed to be unusually literal because of the novel's fantastical conceit. Each of the characters has an externalized component of themselves that acts as both commodity and prosthesis: Kazumasa Ishimaru has a plastic ball from space floating in front of his forehead that reacts to material peculiarities; Batista and Tania Aparecida Djapan have a special connection with courier-pigeons that leads to a global communication network; Mané Pena's love of feathers and expertise regarding their "therapeutic" use come to define him, consuming the other parts of his life; Chico Paco's quest to objectify his spirituality in an altar leads him to establish a pilgrimage network and eventually a radio network; J. B. Tweep has a fully-functional third arm that, increasing his efficiency and propeling him up the corporate ladder, causes him to become coextensive with and augmented by the GGG Corporation. Especially in later sections, characters move *in absentia* through the circulation of these prosthetic additions, making the majority of their interaction with the global multiscape in some way commidity-mediated. 

In this sense, the novel sets up a version of the "commodiscape" I have appended to Appadurai's list of scapes, but it does so with an explicit focus on the human role in each. More specifically, it considers the effects of dematerializing global flows on the human side of the commodisphere: the characters begin to understand *things* primarily in terms of exchange, movement, and *networks* of circulation, a shift that influences their understanding of themselves and the rest of the world. 

At the same time, this immaterial view of objects is accompanied by a kind of push-back from everything that is lost when the material substratum of exchange is ignored. The Matacão, almost a character itself, is the most obvious example: it is an underground, impenetrable mass of congealed plastic, with either magnetic or magical properties, and it results from the kind of waste-production that is only possible by ignoring (on a massive scale) the material basis of consumption. When Matacão is used as a material for the production of commodities, waste, the product of ignoring the material, is turned into the very material basis of exchange. An apex of obliviousness to material is attained when what seems like recycling is mobilized by the profit motive. Waste goes global as contagion, naturalized destruction. When material interchanges are ignored, they demonstrate their own importance by a disjuncture of their own, one so radical that it negates all others. Yamashita's representation of this continual push and pull---with market forces dematerializing everything on one hand and the material, natural basis of *things* reasserting itself in response---boils down to an ethical stance that privileges *attention to materiality* over the immateriality that comes with global circulation. *Through the Arc of the Rainforest*'s version of globalism therefore affirms the premises of Castell's, Bauman's, and Appadurai's versions of global flows while offering a critical environmental intervention: that beneath these flows there is a more basic material system of things, materials, and ecologies without which no flows (or anything else) exist, and that certain types of "disjuncture" put this material basis at risk.

#Kazumasa: Objectified Labor and Human Circulation

For the majority of the novel, such a lofty, global reading would seem well out of reach. Like the soap operas that Yamashita's preface compares it to, the novel concerns itself with people and their relationships, not the abstract circulation of things or statements about capital and the environment. These arguments, if we can call them that, exist in the seams between reality and her imaginative world, especially in the construction of the object-appendages and the Matacão. The ball floating in front of Kazumasa's forehead is the most narratively significant (and not just because it is the narrator of the novel) and receives the most attention. It is also unique among the objects in the novel, however, in the way it synthesizes material interactions, human integration with systems, and movement.

A great deal of emphasis is placed, from the beginning, on the ball's material: it is made out of a plastic-like material, something similar to (or at least that reacts to) the stuff of the Matacão. Almost as much attention is given to how it comes to define Kazumasa. Although it has fallen from the sky, it has attached itself to him permanently, so permanently that, by implication, the only way to take it from him is by killing him. It is not until Kazumasa grows up---enters the labor force, we might say---that his object-appendage begins to mediate his movement and economic relationships. When he does enter the labor force, his ball gets him a job specifically because of its material peculiarity. Because this unique material is at first inherently tied to motion---it starts to be attracted to weaknesses in railroad tracks---its peculiar nature also puts *Kazumasa* in motion. The effects of this prosthetic object are visible in the increase of his sphere of influence. The beginning of his life is narrowly confined to a scale consistent with the powers of his unaugmented body. 

**1Japan0**

The moment his abilities are extended by the object that is augmenting him, though---the moment in which the ball becomes a prosthetic---the extent of his influence expands. 

**1Japan1**

The geographic boundaries of his movement are carefully delineated to emphasize this increase: it is made very clear that he is traveling from Hokkaido, the northernmost portion of Japan, to Nagasaki, which is located in the south (cite). 

Is Kazumasa put into motion or put into circulation? Circulation in the sense I mean relies on exchange, and more specifically the exchange of commodities---objects that are products of labor and are both used and exchanged. Kazumasa's ball is not a product of labor, nor is it exchanged, and therefore the *ball* cannot be taken as a commodity in itself. More precisely, it is a prosthetic portal to the commodiscape. The ball is his only way of performing the labor by which he supports himself, because it is the part of him that responds to the track weaknesses. In a sense unique to the novel, then, Kazumasa's labor power is externalized---objectified in the ball. Though the ball may not be a commodity in itself, it is, in part, a way of physicalizing Kazumasa's commodified labor power. 

It is possible to extend this reading too far. To do so would risk a reductive, allegorical reading of the ball as only (and entirely) commodified labor. Lest we forget, the ball is also the narrator of the novel, and in other contexts it defines his identity---at certain points he is just "The Japanese with the ball" (cite). While such a reading would diverge from the novel, a qualified version of it is essential to the interaction of human, thing, and globalization it depicts: the ball acts as a commodification of labor insofar as it mediates Kazumasa's economic relations. 

Understanding Kazumasa's ball as his labor power externalized can also add some useful context to the conditions of his increasing obsolescence as a railroad maintainer, especially as this obsolescence relates to the extent of his sphere of influence. It is significant that, when Kazumasa eventually loses his position with the railroad company, it is because a new, bigger company has taken over that *replicates his ball exactly* with a *mechanical device* that looks suspiciously like his ball (8). With the ball understood as externalized labor power, the one-for-one replacement of human labor by its mechanical equivalent is imagined as the mechanical reproduction of an object. The result of this replacement is a decrease in the geographical extent of Kazumasa's influence. He is fired, which results "a considerable cut in pay" and a major curtailment of the distance he travels per day (8). 

**1Japan2**

In the first place, a relationship is established here that persists throughout: geographic influence correlates with economic power, as seen here in that fact that a diminution of distance covered per day leads to a wage cut. But the mechanization of Kazumasa's ball has a further-reaching effect on Kazumasa as a human. Just as his ball enters a larger system of essentially mechanical objects, Kazumasa himself becomes, to some extent, mechanical. His circulation in the new system has a strict, regulated period, and the task has all the mindless repetition so characteristic of work within an extensive division of labor. A similar diminution of Kazumasa as an individual occurs later, when the ball has again been mass-produced, but this time as a fashion accessory (148). In both cases, the characteristics of the ball's circulation in a larger system of objects determines the character of Kazumasa's own interaction with larger systems. This is true whether those systems are economic, cultural, or social. It is no surprise that Kazumasa's diminishing status causes him to flee Japan for another locale: São Paulo. 

**Brazil Kazumasa's arrival** 

To change the role of his defining object is to change the way he himself fits into the systems of which he is a part.

Finally, Kazumasa's ball stands in not just for Kazumasa's own labor objectified, but also, in its increasing significance to global and environmental affairs, for the increase of human labor power entire. The stepwise increase in scale---from the local scale of environmental alteration, to the national scale of transportation networks, to the global scale of resource extraction and distribution---encapsulates the increasing environmental influence of *the* human in the story of *an* augmented human. When the focus of Kazumasa's labor changes from railroad tracks to deposits of Matacão around the world, the scale of his material intervention increases to the extent of the globe. His own potential influence becomes coextensive with the GGG Corporation's aspirations.

**GGG's Aspirational Network**

In the first place, linking Kazumasa's subsumption by corporate interest to globality points to the inherence of capitalism and global extraction: national borders are transcended as the nation becomes irrelevant as a global source of power. Bauman might point out that the nation becomes irrelevant in part because of its territoriality, the inability to supersede itself without major acts of military conquest; the super-territorial, transnational corporation can expand without needing a redefinition and without material hindrance. The focus on Matacão, though, suggests an understanding of increasing human labor power in terms of its geological effect. As Dipesh Chakrabarty points out in "The Climate of History: Four Theses," "We [the human species] may not experience ourselves as a geological agent, but we appear to have become one at the level of the species" (221). Chakrabarty's topic is anthropegenic climate change, but in Yamashita's hands the human intervention in planetary geological workings is understood more broadly. The mechanism of interference is, first, waste production in the creation of the Matacão; later, it becomes extraction when Matacão becomes a resource. The most significant difference is, again, that this geological interference occurs at the hands of the augmented individual. Presenting it as such incorporates the expansion of human labor into the narrative of an individual's increasing labor power. It also makes the prosthetic commodity, the objectification of labor power, the means by which the *experience* of geological influence is narrated. Chakarabarty may be right to say that, in the normal course of human life, we do not "experience ourselves as a geological agent," but Yamashita's imaginative novel is not narrating the normal course of human life. The object-appendage, as a window to the commodiscape through labor, makes this geological effect apprehensible experientially to the individual.

Kazumasa's may be the main narrative thread, and it is the most unique in the way that the object-appendage works as an objectification of labor. It is not representative, however, of the object-appendage in general in the novel. The following section will show what happens when circulation occurs in the absence of---or causes the destruction of---the object that motivates it.

#Circulation Without Object

Circulation seems like it should require some *thing* to be circulated, but this common-sense intuition not only does not hold true, but is neatly reversed in *Through the Arc of the Rainforest*. More accurately, *Through the Arc of the Rainforest* demonstrates that this common-sense intuition does not hold true in general: think of the reduction of a commodity to "futures," or the promise to buy a given amount of a given *thing* sometime in the future; think of the increasingly automated and always-higher-speed trade in stocks.^[cite this better, some footnoted examples?] The novel literalizes something that is already happening, and has been happening since the beginning of finance capitalism: the dematerialization of things, exultant ignorance of use and materiality in favor of exchange and ephemerality. "All that is solid melts into air." 

Of course, it could be said that yoking this dematerializing tendency to financialization may make it too recent. Following the classical Marxist line, commodity logic has an inherently immaterial aspect in its very nature. The opening pages of *Capital* establish a split between the use-value of a commodity and its exchange-value, with use-value being broadly aligned with materiality and exchange-value with the spectral value established through comparison. Commodity fetishism is in part the confusion of exchange-value with something inherently material. The difference between this already-somewhat-dematerialized nature of the commodity and the process of dematerialization through finance is a difference of degree, not of kind. When commodities traders can theoretically purchase enough cattle to feed a country without seeing (or conceivably ever having seen) a cow, that is somethign different. It is more different still when an automatic trading algorithm can do so without being *able* to see, or think, a cow. Without the technological mechanism, this is the kind of dematerialization that Yamashita puts in the hands of global circulation.

It should come as no surprise, then, that the narrative key by which this logic is established comes in a financial context. GGG, the corporation founded by Georgia and Geoffrey Gamble that finances J. B. Tweep's large-scale harvesting of Matacão, exists solely on the basis of this kind of circulation, and provides the model by which it can be understood. Like the novel itself, GGG is a kind of terrarium containing constant motion. Its workers are constantly rushing around smoking, yelling at each other, moving things from room to room, and copying documents that refer to nothing: 

> representative block quote

This activity differs from the common-sense business-as-usual in one important sense: it produces nothing; it has no object. Several times in the J. B. Tweep sections of the novel, a great plan or realization is mentioned on the basis of which the Gambles started their business, but it is never clear entirely what it is. **quote** After being sacked by the shareholders, they destroy a small "card" that appears to be the object at the center of the business, or at least some regulating mechanism. Twice it is referred to as a "microchip," but this is the same as making it a non-thing: an unspecified microchip is scarcely an object in itself, more a symbol of the immateriality of the virtual.^[some page numbers?] The important point is that this object, though it is at the center of GGG, is entirely unessential to it. Nobody but Georgia and Geoffrey even know the object exists, and everything continues without it. The genius of GGG's founders lies, at bottom, in this unnecessary central symbol. It is understanding precisely that the object itself is eminently unimportant in relation to the conditions of its exchange, hence the ability of the company to "probably go on almost forever without" the "missing product" that Georgia and Geoff Gamble destroy on their way out of the firm (21). Without this card, a minor, largely forgotten department of the company is left to do the work of finding something to produce with the right specifications of profitability. This task, however, is understood to never be possible until the intervention of J. B. Tweep: **quote**. Because they have invented a company that does not even have to pretend to create something with use-value, a parade of cloned, identical functionaries photocopying their resumes is sufficient to its continuation. The existence of the company does not only not depend on production, its insularity and inward-looking nature prevent production.

The relationship of this company to J. B. Tweep is predictably bizarre and inherently related to appendage and augmentation: Tweep has a fully-functioning third arm, which, as a symbol and cause of the efficiency that makes him the driving source of the company, makes the GGG corporation act as a prosthesis in itself. Corporation as prosthesis, like the dematerialization inherent to commodity circulation in general, is something basic to economic reality that the novel extends to the point of illustrative absurdity. The idea of a company as *corporation*, embodiment, already implies the radical extension of the individuals involved through a communal structure, augmenting the powers of each. Logically, a figure at the head of such an augmentative community would have a privileged relationship to this *corpus*, and in a strictly hierarchical system, it would be possible to see the corporation as the extended body of the individual in charge. J. B. Tweep's situation is unique in that he is emphatically not in charge, pointing out to his three-breasted wife Michelle that advancing in the institutional structure would cause a threat to his privileged position with respect to the powers of the company: **quote**. Nevertheless, Tweep's third arm leads him symbolically and literally to the site of the company's true material power, the product room. **quote about it being the most important department in the company** The result of Tweep's self-augmentation through the company (again, via his literal appendage) is twofold. First, his movement is allowed to be totally unrestricted, consistent with the globalism of the company's influence and interests: he gains the power to move not only himself, but other characters more or less at will. 
**map?**
Second, his powers of material transformation inflate to the point that he is able to turn the Matacão seemingly overnight into a base of operations for GGG---and also, therefore, for himself. Increasing extent of influence correlates to increasing powers of material change---the ability to make the material world malleable, and in a sense, less materially fixed.
**map just tweep side of capital flow?**
The flow of capital becomes a part of Tweep's augmented power as a part of his extension by the corporation. If Kazumasa's ball is in part an objectification of his commodified labor, Tweep's arm is in part an encapsulation of power extended through augmentation. This extended power expresses itself in the ability to make Matacão, the most material of the novel's fantasies, into a reflection of the thing that changes it.^[Hegelian echoes are intentional here, etc.]

The 

Chico Paco's pilgrimages derive from a non-objectified spirituality, but when this spirituality is objectified as an altar he becomes famous, finally coming into his own as a radio star and extending his influence through a network of constantly moving pilgrims.  Mané Pena, who lives on top of the Matacão and initially unearths it, has a "magic" feather for his part, though the only thing magical about it seems to be its ability to relieve stress when rubbed behind the ear. His fixation on these objects leads to his definition according to them: he becomes a world-famous doctor of "featherology" and gets drawn into the global trade of feathers for medicinal and recreational use. Batista and Tania Aparecida train a remarkable bunch of pigeons that lift them out of routine and lead them to founding a global communication network, but the pigeons serve as a kind of extension of Batista from the moment he finds it. Such appendages do not have to be objects, then: nevertheless, materiality is associated with the plant an animal world, and so they fall on the "non-market" side of the ethics I'm arguing Yamashita is establishing in this novel. Finally, and most literally, J. B. Tweep's supplementary appendage is his third arm, which enhances his manual abilities like typing and organizing, an advantage that becomes generalized into success in business through a philosophy of threes he calls "trialectics." Each of these extensions of self eventually becomes monetized, even though each of them begins as a constitutive element of the person to whom it is attached, or who fixates on it. With the monetization the object and its owner enter the stream of circulation.  This is the sense in which commodity circulation becomes a means of extending the scale one's movement and, in a sense, extending the limits of the self: when the commodity enters circulation, so does the character. 

At first glance, this view of the circulation of commodities, as though circulation can exist without the underlying object, seems counter-intuitive, fantastic, even in ways that go beyond the counter-intuitive fantasizing of the novel. This view would be incorrect in two senses, though. First, the novel itself provides a model for understanding circulation *in itself*, that is, without needing something to circulate. It is the model for all the circulation of objects that takes place in *Through the Arc of the Rainforest*. 

The second reason it makes sense to talk about circulation in the absence of, and even destroying, the object that is circulated requires a turn to Marx's view of the commodity and Bill Brown's extension of it in his "Thing Theory," the latter of which I won't be able to bring in until the larger paper. The dematerialization of the commodity can be understood in terms of the division between use-value and exchange-value with which Marx begins the first volume of *Capital*. Most basically and very reductively, use-value is the value of the thing as an object, what it is good for to those who *use* it; exchange-value, on the other hand, is a comparative relation of value through trade. This second value appears to be an inherent value to the object itself, when in fact it is anything but. Without belaboring the details, this separation of material utility and immaterial exchange is very useful for thinking through the model of circulation established in the GGG passages and, through those, the way circulation of trade goes global in general---both in the novel and in the world. Financialization is one of the mechanisms of globalization of capital, and essentially just means separating exchange-value from use-value through profitable circulation. We might think of commodities traders, swapping bundled of commodities without realizing what they're swapping is two parts frozen orange juice and three parts cattle futures, neither of which they deal with directly: to say that circulation depends on an object in this case would come as quite a surprise to those profiting from circulation without much consideration of its material use. In GGG's case, the card containing the totality of the company's product becomes a symbol of this loss of the material side of exchange, and in becoming so it provides the key to understanding the way the many monetized objects, and the people they represent, work in the novel. Each of these objects is practically meaningless in itself, like the feathers that are spread around the globe before they begin to be made synthetically. But the social structures and value systems that inhere in each makes each sufficient to its own form of circulation---value systems like feather addiction (comparisons to tobacco appear throughout), religion, or communication are the masks by which this profit-driven deemphasis of the material thing is concealed. Consistent with commodity logic, the material aspects of the thing are overlooked in favor of exchange value and, through it, social value. To quote a more famous passage from Marx, under capitalism---and we should specify, especially global, financial capitalism---"All that is solid melts into air."
